    "title": "BITCOINS FALLACY OF FIXED SUPPLY",
    "selftext": "The Fallacy of Fixed Supply: Bitcoin’s Duality of Doom-\n\n\" Bitcoin’s defining feature - the 21 million coin cap - is marketed as its guarantee of scarcity and value. In reality, this cap creates a paradox that undermines the network’s long‑term viability. The system is trapped between two mutually exclusive requirements:\n- Scarcity (the fixed cap)\n- Security (the perpetual energy bill of proof‑of‑work)\nBitcoin cannot sustain both. Either scarcity collapses through inflationary “tail emissions,” or security collapses as miners abandon the network. This paper outlines why Bitcoin’s architecture is doomed to fail regardless of which path is chosen.\n1. The Nominal Illusion\n- Bitcoin peaked at $126K in October 2025.\n- Adjusted for inflation (2020 dollars), the peak was only $99,848.\n- In real terms, Bitcoin today trades around $70K the same level as late 2021.\n- Implication: Four years of energy burn and billions in mining costs have produced zero real progress in purchasing power.\n2. The Energy Treadmill\n- Since the 2021 halving, Bitcoin’s network hash rate has risen ~394%.\n- Energy input has quadrupled, yet real output (purchasing power) is flat.\n- In any other industry, rising input with stagnant output = technological regression.\n- Bitcoin is unique in requiring more work for less progress.\n3. Security Economics\n- Bitcoin’s security depends on proof‑of‑work: miners expend energy to build a “wall” against attacks.\n- To rewrite the ledger, an attacker must control &gt;51% of hash power.\n- Cost of attack (2025): $6–20 billion in hardware + electricity for one week.\n- Security paradox: If miners leave, the wall collapses. A 90% drop in hash rate reduces the attack cost from $20B to $2B.\n4. The Scarcity Trap\n- The 21M cap means block rewards decline to zero.\n- Miners are paid in two ways:\n- Block rewards (new coins)\n- Transaction fees\n- As rewards vanish, fees must rise to sustain security.\n- Current math (2025):\n- Block reward: 3.125 BTC\n- Fees: ~0.06 BTC per block\n- Fees = &lt;2% of security budget\n- To replace rewards, fees must rise by 5,000% (&gt;$100 per transaction).\n- If fees don’t rise, miners leave → security collapses.\n5. The Security Trap\n- If coins are “stored” and not transacted, fees vanish.\n- No fees = no money for miners = no security.\n- Bitcoin becomes a “ghost town” of HODLers with no guards at the vault.\n- AI firms now outbid miners for electricity, accelerating the exodus.\n6. Tail Emissions: The Final Trickery\n- Developers propose “tail emissions”: perpetual inflationary rewards to pay miners.\n- This breaks the 21M cap, killing the “digital gold” narrative.\n- Maximalists face a religious war:\n- Keep the cap → lose security.\n- Break the cap → lose scarcity.\n- Even BlackRock warns: “There are no guarantees the 21 million maximum supply won’t change.”\n7. Industrial Eviction\n- Mining firms (e.g., Hut ) are pivoting to AI hosting.\n- AI workloads pay 5x more per kilowatt than Bitcoin mining.\n- Security collapse doesn’t require a hacker — it requires miners choosing better clients.\n- Bitcoin is being priced out of its own energy market.\n8. The Self‑Custody Fallacy\n- Claim: “ETFs are the problem - self‑custody fixes it.”\n- Reality: Custody only addresses counterparty risk. It does not fix network risk.\n- Whether coins are held in ETFs, exchanges, or cold wallets, the network still faces:\n- Declining block rewards.\n- Insufficient transaction fees.\n- Miner exodus to more profitable industries.\n- Self‑custody doesn’t pay the electric bill. ETFs don’t pay the electric bill. Only miners do - and they’re already defecting.\n9. The Duality of Doom\n- Scarcity vs. Security: mutually exclusive.\n- Keep scarcity→ miners starve, security collapses.\n- Keep security → print coins, scarcity collapses.\n- Either path destroys the “store of value” narrative.\n10. The Verdict\n- Bitcoin is not a store of value.\n- It is a store of maintenance, requiring perpetual energy burn to survive.\n- The “fixed supply” is not a feature - it is a countdown clock to obsolescence.\n- In 2025, the bill is coming due:\n- Zero real progress in purchasing power.\n- Escalating energy costs.\n- A looming choice between inflation or insecurity.\nConclusion\nBitcoin’s architecture is a paradox. Its scarcity is inseparable from its security budget, and its security budget is inseparable from perpetual energy burn. The system cannot sustain both indefinitely. The “21 million cap” is not a guarantee of value - it is the ultimate trickery, a design flaw that ensures Bitcoin’s eventual collapse.\nSelf‑custody, ETFs, or any other wrapper do not solve this. The treadmill burns on regardless. You either lose scarcity, or you lose security. Either way, the “store of value” narrative dies.\nYou can say \" thank you Ai \" but then you have to ask what prompted Ai to realize this and you are more than welcome (and I actually encourage it ) to debate me or choose the path of deflection and mock ai - it's irrelevant to and for the point.\nHowever, if you mock you still have to wrestle with \" The final Trickery\" The Proposal: A group of prominent Bitcoin developers (like Peter Todd) have realized that the '21 Million Cap' is a security suicide pact. They are proposing a change to the code that would print a small amount of Bitcoin forever to pay the miners.\nP.S. The Verdict: The Tail Emission debate is the 'Final Confession' that Bitcoin has a designed-in expiration date: You either lose the scarcity or you lose the security. Either way, the 'Store of Value' argument is debunked by the Tail Emissions debate and the architecture which necessitated a need for this attempt at a solution.\nEven BlackRock recently added a disclaimer to their Bitcoin fund stating:\" There are no guarantees that the 21 million maximum supply won't change.' They’ve seen the math and the math ain't mathing. \"",

    "selftext": "Recently, One of my friends bought one of the One Shot bitcoin miners, for \\~67 dollars (I'm not joking) and he was talking about how he has a slim chance to get a little over 3 bitcoins every 10 minutes, but I think it's all a bad investment and that he should have invested it in something more reliable, so I was wondering if anyone's actually gotten bitcoins from the device, or if it's just a huge waste of money. So if anyone has gotten bitcoins, or knows someone who has gotten bitcoin from the device, please let me know. Thanks!",

    "selftext": "I have been thinking about a potential long term centralization risk in Bitcoin that does not get discussed as much as mining pools or hashrate geography.\nI am not talking about pools, government bans, or a classic 51 percent attack.\nI am talking about ASIC manufacturing concentration.\nHistorically, and still largely today, the majority of Bitcoin ASIC miners have been designed and produced by a very small number of companies, mainly Bitmain, MicroBT, and Canaan, all originating from China. Even when final assembly moves elsewhere, chip design, firmware, and supply chains remain highly concentrated.\nMy question is not whether they could flip a switch and kill Bitcoin. They obviously cannot.\nMy concern is more subtle and long term.\nIf a single country, or a small set of aligned manufacturers, controls most new hashpower production, could that create:\n- Coordinated control over hardware supply\n- Preferential access to the newest and most efficient machines\n- Firmware level behavior that is difficult for miners to audit\n- A structural barrier to entry for smaller or independent miners\n\nSo not a sudden takeover, but a slow influence over who can economically mine Bitcoin at scale.\nI understand that Bitcoin security depends on miners choosing where to point hashpower, not on who manufactures the machines. But hardware is still the physical root of that power.\nSo my honest question to the community is this.\nWhere do you think the real boundary of risk is here?\nIs this a non issue because market incentives and competition solve it over time, or is ASIC manufacturing one of Bitcoin’s remaining centralized choke points that we simply accept as a trade off?",

    "title": "The Ultimate Bull Case for Bitcoin in the 21st Century.",
    "selftext": "At first glance, the bull case for Bitcoin seems almost self-evident. A fixed supply of 21 million coins. A decentralized monetary network immune to political interference. A digital asset that has outperformed nearly every traditional investment over the past decade. Bitcoin is often described as “digital gold,” a pristine form of money for a digital world—borderless, censorship-resistant, and mathematically scarce.\n\nInstitutions are here. ETFs exist. Sovereign wealth funds are rumored to be allocating. Governments are running trillion-dollar deficits, fiat currencies are steadily debased, and confidence in central banks continues to erode. In that environment, Bitcoin appears to offer salvation: an incorruptible ledger, an apolitical monetary system, and a hedge against monetary collapse.\n\nBut beneath this polished narrative, cracks begin to form—and when examined closely, the bull case collapses into something far less convincing.\n\nScarcity Alone Is Not Value\n\nBitcoin’s primary claim to value is scarcity. But scarcity by itself does not create demand. Something must be wanted for reasons beyond its limited supply.\n\nGold is scarce, yes—but gold is also used. Silver is scarce—and silver is consumed. Bitcoin, by contrast, is scarce but functionally inert.\n\nGold and silver are not merely monetary relics; they are foundational materials in modern civilization. Gold is used in semiconductors, aerospace components, medical devices, and advanced electronics because of its conductivity and resistance to corrosion. Silver is critical in solar panels, batteries, missiles, guidance systems, 5G infrastructure, and data centers. Every smartphone, every satellite, every weapons system relies on physical metals that do something.\n\nBitcoin does not.\n\nBitcoin Has No Industrial Demand\n\nBitcoin cannot be embedded in a semiconductor. It cannot be plated onto a circuit board. It cannot be used in missile guidance systems, radar arrays, or advanced computing hardware. It cannot be consumed by data centers, AI accelerators, or defense contractors.\n\nIn other words, Bitcoin has zero non-monetary demand.\n\nIf tomorrow every investor lost interest in Bitcoin as a speculative or monetary asset, demand would fall to nearly zero. Gold and silver, even in a monetary collapse or a speculative bust, would still be required to keep the modern world functioning. They have a floor of demand rooted in physics, chemistry, and engineering. Bitcoin has no such floor.\n\n“Digital Gold” Breaks Under Scrutiny\n\nBitcoin is often compared to gold, but the analogy breaks down quickly.\n\nGold does not require electricity to exist.\nGold does not rely on the internet.\nGold does not depend on miners staying solvent.\nGold does not fork.\nGold does not suffer from protocol risk.\nGold does not face existential threats from software bugs, quantum computing, or regulatory choke points.\n\nGold has been money for 5,000 years across every civilization, ideology, and technological era. Bitcoin has existed for barely over a decade, entirely within a high-energy, high-connectivity global system that it cannot survive without.\n\nIn a true crisis—war, grid failure, cyberattack, or prolonged energy shortage—Bitcoin doesn’t become more valuable. It becomes inaccessible.\n\nEnergy Dependence Is a Weakness, Not a Feature\n\nBitcoin proponents argue that energy usage is a strength, that proof-of-work anchors Bitcoin to reality. But this ignores a simple truth: energy scarcity kills Bitcoin’s usability.\n\nData centers consume energy but provide indispensable services. Semiconductor fabs consume energy but produce irreplaceable components. Military infrastructure consumes energy because it must.\n\nBitcoin consumes energy purely to maintain consensus over ownership of a digital token that has no use outside of itself. It is a closed loop. Energy goes in, hashes come out, nothing tangible is produced.\n\nIf energy becomes more expensive or more regulated, Bitcoin mining becomes less viable—not more valuable.\n\nNo Role in National Security or Industry\n\nGold is held by central banks because it is politically neutral, physically sovereign, and universally recognized. Silver is stockpiled because it is critical to defense systems and advanced technology.\n\nBitcoin plays no role in national security.\nIt cannot be stockpiled for emergencies.\nIt cannot be melted down, repurposed, or deployed.\nIt cannot function without private keys, infrastructure, and connectivity.\n\nNo nation will defend Bitcoin supply chains.\nNo military will secure Bitcoin production.\nNo strategic reserve depends on Bitcoin to function.\n\nThat alone should raise questions about its long-term relevance.\n\nBitcoin’s Value Is Reflexive—and Fragile\n\nBitcoin’s price is driven almost entirely by belief. People buy it because they believe others will buy it later at a higher price. That reflexivity works on the way up—but it works just as brutally on the way down.\n\nGold and silver do not require belief. They are demanded regardless of sentiment. Missiles will still need silver. Chips will still need gold. Data centers will still need conductive metals.\n\nBitcoin needs confidence. And confidence is not a durable foundation.\n\nThe Uncomfortable Conclusion\n\nBitcoin is not useless—but it is narrow.\n\nIt is not money in the traditional sense.\nIt is not an industrial commodity.\nIt is not a strategic resource.\nIt is not embedded into the physical economy.\n\nIt is a speculative monetary experiment that thrives in conditions of excess liquidity, stable infrastructure, and high risk appetite. Those conditions may persist—but if they reverse, Bitcoin has nothing beneath it to catch the fall.\n\nGold and silver anchor civilization at the atomic level.\nBitcoin exists entirely in abstraction.\n\nAnd when abstraction collides with reality, reality tends to win.\n",

    "title": "Paradox With Bitcoin",
    "selftext": "Hey, I'm a 5+ year holder. I stopped caring about the memes and language years ago.\n\nJust an observation, but I think many of us are in a paradox wrt money supply and appreciation of the asset. People on this sub criticize the Fed for injecting liquidity into the economy, yet many also gleefully get excited for \"mooning\" and \"money printer go brrrr...\" ad nauseum.\n\nBitcoin is a young risk asset and correlates heavily with M2 supply. Therefore, the very stimulus which devalues the dollar ends up pumping Bitcoin after several months of QE.\n\nI'm beginning to wonder what would happen if the Fed did not inject liquidity as it does today. I'm guessing markets and all assets will correct hard, and we'll see a prolonged recession. The silver lining might be it will return the purchasing power of USD back to people. Next, Bitcoin drops to the lowest end of the power function curve and folks can buy at a major discount and it will appreciate slowly according to its halving schedule.\n\nI suppose the honest way to look at Bitcoin is recognizing given the Fed regularly injects liqudity to keep markets intact, it has consequences such as maintaining/prolonging asset bubbles. Bitcoin happens to benefit from these liqudity injections and it appreciates faster (sometimes) relative to other assets like gold or stocks. Therefore, it's better to hold some Bitcoin. But, in being honest, given current central bank monetary policy, we're all cheering for the decline of dollar purchasing power.\n\nJust a thought experiment. Sorta reminds me of that scene from the Big Short when the characters shorted a bunch of CDOs and Brad Pitt said, \"Don't fucking dance\"",

Everyone is now an expert and can get the right information when needed. \n\n\n\nFor example, when asked what the best payment cryptocurrency, Gemini 3 ignored Bitcoin and other well-known cryptocurrencies. AI is now changing how everything is viewed. This will have a big impact on the next generation. Hype experts and paid influencers will be filtered out. AI now rewards technologies that logically solve problems, rather than those that generate the most noise. \n\nhttps://gemini.google.com/share/ca81dccb73e2\n\n\nThe New Year will be a new beginning, exposing what is next. New Candle , I think it will Be Red for most coins , because most are scams\n\nLike Akon saying ,\nI'm tryna be strong\nBut the strength I have is washin' away\nRight now Na Na Na ",

    "selftext": "This isn’t a hit piece and it’s not anti-Bitcoin. I hold BTC and I genuinely believe in the thesis.\n\nBut sometimes I catch myself wondering if the community has crossed into something like unwavering faith.\n\nNo matter the macro news, geopolitical shifts, technological changes, regulation, or even legitimate criticisms, the response often feels pre-written:\n“Zoom out.”\n“Fiat is doomed.”\n“NGU forever.”\n\nAgain, a lot of that may be right. Bitcoin has earned a ton of conviction. But conviction can quietly turn into blinders if you’re not careful.\n\nMy concern isn’t that Bitcoin fails. It’s that I don’t want to become intellectually lazy or dismissive of real changes in the world simply because they don’t fit the narrative. Ironically, that’s the exact mindset Bitcoin was supposed to protect us from. The establishment that never questions itself.\n\nSo I’m curious how others here think about this:\n\nHow do you maintain strong conviction without turning it into dogma?\n\nWhere’s the line between rational long-term belief and faith that refuses to be challenged?\n\nWhat would actually make you reconsider parts of the thesis, if anything?\n\nI’m not looking for doom. I’m looking for intellectual honesty.\n\nWould love thoughtful responses from people who’ve been around for multiple cycles, not just memes and slogans.",

It doesn’t try to reconstruct mempool state or validate transactions — it only looks at what leaks through at the network level.\n\n\n\nI fully agree this can’t (and shouldn’t) replace a real node. The point is more to explore:\n\n\\- what breaks first when you remove assumptions\n\n\\- what remains observable at the edge\n\n\\- and whether those weak signals are still useful\n\n\n\nStill very early and experimental, but I’d be genuinely interested in feedback from people who’ve thought about Bitcoin from a network or protocol-level perspective.\n\n\n\nIf the answer turns out to be “nothing useful”, that’s fine too.",

    "selftext": "If Bitcoin reaches $700,000, the first thing to break isn't the system.\n\nThis idea came to me while reading a conversation within the Bitunix community. It wasn't a price analysis or a prediction, but a normal discussion among users about adoption, money, and long-term decisions. And the more I thought about it, the clearer the question became.\n\nIf Bitcoin ever reaches $700,000, the real impact won't be financial. It will be psychological.\n\nAt that point, Bitcoin ceases to be a risky bet and becomes uncomfortable truth. A signal that was there for years, within everyone's reach. Exchanges, communities, forums… the information was always available. Bitunix is ​​just one example of that.\n\nThe real shock will come when the conversation stops being \"when should I buy?\" and becomes \"why didn't I act when I could?\"\nNo banking collapse would be necessary for this to happen. It would be enough for the price to hold at that level. Trust in the current system doesn't break down suddenly; it erodes little by little.\n\n\nPeople will start questioning basic things: why save in something that loses value, why measure progress only in salaries, why accept rules that are constantly changing.\n\n\nBitcoin at 700,000 won't force anyone to use it.\nIt will simply highlight that an alternative existed.\n\n\nI don't know if that price will be reached or not.\n\nBut if it is, the system won't be the first thing to break.\n\n\nIt will be the personal narrative of millions of people.\n\n\nWhat do you think?\nDoes the mindset change first… or do the rules of the game change?",

I realized that selling \"merch\" is pointless if people don't understand WHY we need Bitcoin in the first place. So I deleted my bio and wrote \"The Truth\" about the fiat system instead.\n\nI wrote this line which is now the core of the project:\n\"Conviction precedes possession. Wearing a protocol only makes sense if you understand what it replaces.\"\n\nHere is a snippet from the page:\n\n\"Limited Supply Is Not An Option. It Is The Point.\nEvery fiat currency fails for the same reason: infinite supply controlled by the few. As soon as money can be printed at will, it ceases to be a store of value. It becomes a tool of extraction. Savings are diluted. Labor is devalued. Time is stolen.\"\n\nI am NOT posting the link to the site here because I respect the community rules against shilling. I just want genuine feedback on the writing.\n\nDoes this text honor the ethos properly? Or is it too aggressive for an \"About\" page?\n\nThanks \n",

    "selftext": "\nBitcoin is still stuck in the same range and that’s why it feels “dead” right now. Price keeps failing to close above $90,000, and that level is strong because several signals line up there (the main trading zone/POC and the 0.618 Fibonacci area). Every time BTC taps that zone, it gets pushed back down.\n\nZooming out, BTC is basically rotating inside a bigger box: $97,500 on top and $80,500 on the bottom. Right now it’s sitting near the middle around $87,000, and the middle of a range usually gives no clear direction.\n\nThe key level to watch is $85,500. If it holds, BTC can keep chopping sideways. If BTC loses $85,500 on a closing basis, the downside risk increases toward the lower end of the range near $80,500.",

    "selftext": "This isn’t a price prediction, just an observation about how gold and bitcoin are behaving relative to the money supply at very different points in their respective cycles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGold Is Testing a 50-Year Ceiling While Bitcoin Tests Its Cycle Floor\n\n\nWhen gold is measured against the U.S. money supply, it’s back at a level that historically marked major turning points. This ratio was last seen in 2011 and before that in the early 1970s, just ahead of gold’s explosive multi-year run.\n\n\nToday, gold has rallied about 70% this year and is pressing against that same long-term ceiling again. At the same time, bitcoin is moving in the opposite direction, retracing toward a key support level near the April “tariff tantrum” low, which also aligns with the prior cycle high from March 2024.\n\n\nThis isn’t a simple risk-on or risk-off signal. It shows gold being treated as the ultimate monetary hedge, while #bitcoin is still working through its cycle structure. Historically, bitcoin has lagged at moments like this before reasserting itself relative to money supply.\n\n\nTwo assets tied to debasement. Two very different moments in the cycle.",

Older coins (1.5+ years, multi-year) barely moved on-chain. These “liquidation hunts” will keep happening as long as people insist on leveraging short-term positions... there’s no real structural reason for price to stay pinned down here beyond providing fresh liquidation fuel.

For those not aware, it a peer to peer, non custodial exchange centered on BTC that can facilitate exchanges between BTC , and a limited set of cryptocurrencies, and fiat.

There is no BCH. This seems odd since PIVX and Litecoin are both there, why no BCH?\n\nNo I do understand that this is an open source project, and that to Add BCH, someone has to write the code and submit a pull request, but my understanding is that BCH has existed in Bisq and was removed. Can anuyone explain what happend and if there is any prospect of integrating Bisq with BCH once more?\n\nIn addition I note that there was an open source project to implement a similar exchange using BCH as the base crypto, it would be a fork of the Bisq code and it would not be called Bisq (Obviously.) That seems a great idea, with BCH low fees and fast confirmation times making it uniquely suited to this as far as I can see. Yet the project appears to have floundered. Is that true? Is'nt that something we should be pushing? It sounds like a textbook use case for BCH. And one that could make full use of BCH contract facilities.\n\nAgain, I'd like to know what happened and if the project made any progress?",

It’s about changing how banking itself works.\n\nIf adoption continues, on-chain banking could become a base layer for global digital finance.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nWe’ve all heard about the “Whole Coiner” milestone. It’s the classic goal: owning one full unit of the hardest money ever created. But let’s be real—from a risk management and psychological perspective, there is a status that’s even more prestigious and liberating.\n\nI’m talking about the moment you’ve withdrawn (realized) more capital than you ever deposited.\n\nAt this point, your investment is \"bulletproof.\" You sleep like a baby during a 50% crash because you have zero personal skin in the game. You are officially playing with \"house money.\"\n\nI think we need a definitive term for this—something as catchy as “Whole Coiner” but focused on financial victory. Here are my proposals. Which one hits the hardest?\n\n \\- Net Coiner\n\nThe professional’s choice. You are \"Net Positive.\" Your bank account is higher than it was before you started, yet you still have a position. It’s about clean, strategic dominance over the market.\n\n \\- Pure Coiner\n\nIt implies your remaining stack is \"Pure\"—free from debt, free from risk, and free from the anxiety of a total loss. It is the purest form of ownership because the market can no longer take anything from you.\n\n\\- The Extractor\n\nA more aggressive take. You didn't just \"wait\" for the price to go up; you extracted value from the volatility. You aren't a passive passenger; you’re the pilot who mastered the system and made it pay out.\n\n\\- Ghost Holder\n\nYou still hold the asset, but you’ve become \"invisible\" to market risk. You are emotionally untouchable—a \"ghost\" in the system that FUD and FOMO can no longer haunt.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\nI see too many people HODLing into infinity without ever experiencing the absolute freedom of having their initial capital secured. Being a Whole Coiner is a great start, but becoming a pure coiner is how you actually win the game.\n\nWhat do you think? Which term best describes this \"God Mode\" of investing? Or do you have a better ones?",

They also say 'MJB 2013' on the back. Looking online I found the same design in various metals but the copper ones always seem to be copper coloured and not gold coloured. Furthermore, mine weigh 24 to 25 grams (my scales aren't too accurate) which doesn't match any that I've found. Does anyone know what these are, how much they are worth, anything about them??",

    "selftext": "I’ve followed this sub daily for years, and over the last month I’ve noticed a lot more negative, or faintly negative, posts than usual.\n\nWhat stands out to me is a possible correlation between the sentiment during the 80-90k pullback and the sentiment now.\n\nDuring the pullback, it felt like the dominant narrative was that cycles always repeat, bitcoin winter was starting, and BTC would “inevitably” crash to 40 to 50k. A lot of people seemed confident selling to buy back lower, and anyone suggesting BTC might hold up better than that got heavily pushed back on.\n\nNow BTC is holding steady around 85 to 90k, and this may very well be the local bottom, and the sub still feels unusually negative relative to what price is doing. My take is that some of today’s negativity might be connected to that earlier consensus. People who sold expecting 40 to 50k may be frustrated it hasn’t happened, and that frustration is showing up as bearish posting, doom takes, and generally sour sentiment.\n\nI’m genuinely curious if others see the same correlation, or if you think the negativity is coming from something else.",

    "selftext": "This question was asked on Bitunix earlier today while I was browsing through many posts about market trends and caught my attention. It made me realize how important this level would be for our society.\n\nIf Bitcoin gets to this level, it will no longer just be a profit opportunity for most individuals. People will weight on when they purchased Bitcoin. Will they acknowledge that they missed the boat, or will they convince themselves that the $1,000,000 was never plausible anyway? Does regret evolve in to denial? Is the trust of people in flexible money gradually replaced by people having trust in strict rules without going through a massive collapse?\n\nWhen I think about this situation, I believe the single greatest disturbing element will not be economic. It will be psychological in nature. The way individuals perceive money, their effort, and look back on their personal choice.\n\nI would be interested in what others think. If Bitcoin continues to grow to $1,000,000, what happens first? Does our mindful set change prior to the shift in the financial systems employed to facilitate our lives?",

But when you zoom out across multiple sessions, the behaviour is too clean for random market participants.\n\nI’m not saying it’s manipulation — just that the footprint doesn’t match what retail flow normally looks like.\n\nWhat’s more interesting is that this behaviour only becomes obvious when you stop looking at the aggregated book and start comparing distribution patterns across account clusters.\n\nI’d post the breakdown, but it’s not something that shows up on public dashboards.",

    "selftext": "I've been holding Bitcoin for about 2 years now and it's done pretty well. Got about $8k worth currently. The thing is I need around $3-4k for some unexpected expenses but I really don't want to sell my Bitcoin because I'm bullish long-term and don't want to trigger a taxable event.\n\nSomeone mentioned crypto loans where you can borrow cash using your Bitcoin as collateral. Sounds interesting but I honestly don't understand how it works or if it's a good idea.\n\nFrom what I've pieced together:\n\n* You put up your crypto as collateral\n* They lend you cash (USD, EUR, whatever)\n* You pay interest on the loan\n* Eventually you pay it back and get your crypto back\n\nBut I have a bunch of questions:\n\n**How much can you actually borrow?** Like if I have $8k in Bitcoin, can I borrow $4k? Or is it less because of some ratio thing?\n\n**What happens if Bitcoin price drops?** This is the part that worries me. If BTC crashes while I have a loan out, do they just take my Bitcoin? How does that work exactly?\n\n**What are the interest rates like?** Is it comparable to a personal loan from a bank or way higher?\n\n**Which platforms actually do this?** I've heard of Nexo and maybe YouHodler? Are there others? Are they safe or is this risky business?\n\n**Is this actually better than just selling?** I keep thinking maybe I'm overcomplicating this and should just sell $4k of Bitcoin, pay the taxes, and be done with it. The loan thing seems appealing but also feels like there's hidden complexity or risks I'm not seeing.\n\nHas anyone here actually taken out a crypto loan? How did it work out? Any gotchas I should know about before even considering this?",

Traders are watching MicroStrategy’s mNAV ratio (currently 1.2x); a drop below 1.0x could validate bearish bets, while stability could trigger relief rallies.\n\n   \nU.S. CPI Data (Jan 13, 2026) Inflation figures may influence Fed rate expectations, impacting Bitcoin’s appeal as a risk asset.\n\n   \nMSCI DAT Decision (Jan 15, 2026) Potential exclusion of Bitcoin-heavy firms from equity indexes could cause $2.8B+ in passive outflows.\n\n   \nFed Rate Decision (Jan 28, 2026) An 80% chance of rates remaining unchanged. Hawkish messaging could pressure BTC, while dovish signals may support upside.  \nThe immediate focus is on MicroStrategy’s year-end risk event. Post-event, CPI and Fed liquidity signals will likely shape Bitcoin’s Q1 2026 trajectory. A supportive environment could offer one of the first bullish catalysts for the new year.",

    "selftext": "Ig there will be an alt rally (this doesn’t mean a new ath for alts) but not a super cycle or smth crazy. Take a look, 99% of alts didn’t make a new alth not only this but now they are at their all time bottoms while the bear market has barely started so what will happen to alts when the bear market is done ? Will they be in minus ? Lol. If they don’t pump the alts, who will they fool in the next cycle to buy alts? Also when it comes to eth, eth sucked this cycle with a poor performance. Note that eth is supposed to be the king of this market after btc. Note that eth has contracts with big companies and sovereign wealth funds. Do you think they would be ok with that Eth performance?. The third reason is liquidation map, look at any coin’s map and let’s take btc as an example if btc pumps to 100k, around 9 billion will be liquidated. How would it be for alts when it pumps like 2-3x ? Do you imagine only 13% pump in btc (and I didn’t mention the rest of the market’s pump) will make half of the total liquidations that happened the last flash crash (19 billion) that’s the highest liquidation in a single day of all time.\nSo my take is we will have an alt rally when they can make 3-5x from their bottoms, so they can fool some dudes into buying alts during the next cycle with the “alts with more risk than btc = more profits than in btc” and the game goes on. Also i guess there will be another final dip incoming before this happens.",

    "selftext": "Currently, the liquid network serves an important purpose in my opinion.\n\nIt allows you to transact funds off chain, while keeping the ability for cold storage with the trade off of the bitcoin being custodied by a federation of entities that should generally want bitcoin to succeed.\n\nLiquid bitcoin (L-BTC) can also be redeemed for real on chain bitcoin at any moment. Am I missing something? This seems perfect and solves most problems of lightning.\n\nIn the case of Aqua wallet, it stores all l2 bitcoin in Liquid, then swaps to Lightning if you need to make a Lightning transaction. This means you can transact bitcoin on Lightning like normal, while still being able to cold storage without moving on chain.\n\nIn the future, we won’t all be able to do on chain transactions, so we need to adopt a good scaling solution with minimal trade offs.",

    "selftext": "**There are an enormous number of Bitcoin options expiring this Friday, December 26, 2025** — marking one of the largest (if not the absolute largest) options expirations in crypto history.\n\nThe bulk of the action is on **Deribit** (acquired by Coinbase last Summer), where approximately **$23–$24 billion** in Bitcoin options are set to expire. This represents over **50%** of Deribit's total open interest and is described across multiple sources as a record-breaking event (often called the \"Boxing Day\" expiry due to the December 26 holiday). For context, this **dwarfs** typical monthly expirations and includes a heavy concentration of call options reflecting bullish positioning earlier in the year.\n\n[https://www.deribit.com/statistics/BTC/options-data](https://www.deribit.com/statistics/BTC/options-data)\n\nThere is a big spike at 100k, and the next largest is 85k.  \n\nThe overall bias leans bullish (low put-call ratios like 0.38 on Deribit), but with downside protection via puts. Max Pain levels (where the most options expire worthless) are at $95,000 per coinglass.\n\n[https://www.coinglass.com/pro/options/max-pain](https://www.coinglass.com/pro/options/max-pain)\n\nWe are at 87.7k right now.   95k friday EoD is 7k pop, but then all the options expire and there is nothing as massive as this event pinning btc down from a market maker perspective.

    "selftext": "**Hi everyone,**\n\nAs a Christmas gift to the community, I wanted to share a project I've been working on: The complete algebraic reconstruction of the **Genesis Block Preimage**.\n\nWhile everyone knows the hash `000000000019d6...`, few have looked at the raw 80-byte header as a mathematical system. Using a constraint-based solver (The **Kaoru Bridge Solver**), I have mapped out the internal message schedule ($W\\_0$ to $W\\_{63}$) that leads to that legendary hash.\n\nThe \"Satoshi DNA\" (80-byte Hex):\n\n0100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003ba3edfd7a7b12b27ac72c3e67768f617fc81bc3888a51323a9fb8aa4b1e5e4a29ab5f49ffff001d1dac2b7c\n\nVerification:\n\nIf you run this through a double SHA-256 (Little Endian), it yields the exact Genesis Hash with its 10 leading zeros.\n\nWhy is this interesting?\n\nIt's a deep dive into the entropy Satoshi chose. It confirms the exact structure of the first 512 bits of the blockchain and proves that the message schedule can be unwound using bitwise consistency analysis.\n\n**Open Source Proof:**\n\n* **Notebook &amp; Solver:**[https://osf.io/f2gd8](https://osf.io/f2gd8)\n* **Hash Collision Proof:**[https://osf.io/8x6un/files/fqazs](https://osf.io/8x6un/files/fqazs)\n\nBitcoin’s math is beautiful and, as it turns out, fully reconstructible if you know where to look.\n\n**Happy Holidays!**",

    "title": "24B BTC Options Expiry Could Be the Catalyst the Market Has Been Waiting For",
    "selftext": "Bitcoin may finally be setting up for the move traders have been watching for weeks. On December 26, the largest BTC options expiration in history is coming due, nearly $24 billion worth of contracts rolling off at once. For a while now, price has felt pinned, moving inside the 85 90k range as if something was holding it in place.\n\nThis kind of compression often happens ahead of major derivatives events. Volatility dries up, price action looks unnatural, and the market feels oddly quiet. But once that pressure is released, the structure tends to shift fast. With max pain sitting closer to the 95k area, it’s not surprising that many are eyeing higher levels once the expiry is out of the way.\n\nHistorically, the Christmas period has a habit of delivering sharp moves, often in the 5–7 percent range, driven more by positioning and derivatives flows than by headlines. Right now, a portion of capital is sitting in equities and precious metals, but any meaningful pullback there could trigger rotation back into Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nThese moves rarely happen when the crowd is confident. More often, they start when patience is wearing thin and expectations are low. That’s usually when the market decides to surprise everyone.\n\nfeels like the calm before the storm tbh… anyone else feeling this quiet is kinda creepy? ",

Multisig helps, but UX and recovery are still where things break.\n\nI’ve been exploring an approach that combines:\n\n●     multisig\n\n●     native time-delays\n\n●     explicit recovery paths\n\nThe idea is to change the failure mode from *instant irreversible loss* to *delay + recoverability*.\n\nI’m curious how others here think about:\n\n●     time-delays as a security primitive\n\n●     whether recovery should be first-class or avoided entirely\n\n●     where multisig UX still fundamentally fails\n\nI’m working on a project called **BitVault** that explores this design space, but mostly posting to learn how people here think about the tradeoffs.",

Between liquidity issues, unpredictable macro factors, and Bitcoin struggling to break higher, it’s been harder to lock in consistent profits.\n\nA lot of traders i know are shifting strategies, some are leaning into longer term holds, others are experimenting with structured events or smaller altcoin plays. Personally, i am considering whether to diversify my approach a bit. I might try Phase 13 of the Bitget Crazy 48H event, where traders can earn $BGB while trading, just to see if it offers a different angle in this sideways market.\n\nThe bigger point is that profit opportunities exist, but they are not as straightforward as before. It feels like this cycle requires more patience, risk management, and creativity than the last.\n\nHow others here are adapting, are you sticking to long term altcoin positions, rotating into majors, or exploring event driven trading strategies?\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitget-token-new/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitget-token-new/)",

One thing I noticed but it's not mentioned by anyone is that every time gold goes up in price all the BTC and crypto goes down and then vice versa. Which probably mean (for all the people asking when BTC price will go crazy) the most likely outcome is - When gold starts to cool down and drops significantly from its ATH. Then those billions will flow in other assets like for example BTC and crypto market. One thing is for sure and that is nothing is certain but this makes sense when you see the big picture. Also remember that the power of BTC is in decentralisation and not solely the price. If you expect to become rich with BTC better not buy at all and that's because you don't understand what it stands for. It's an asset which you can move around, sell quick, keep in your brain (literally 12-24words seed phrase and that's it). Now try doing this with gold and gold bars or coins. Open your eyes people!

A large concentration of open interest around current price levels can create strong gamma effects. Dealers managing these positions are incentivized to hedge dynamically — buying into dips and selling into rallies — in order to remain neutral.\n\nThis hedging behavior can mechanically compress price action, reduce realized volatility, and keep spot price range-bound, even when broader macro assets move decisively.\n\nWith a significant portion of bitcoin options open interest approaching expiry, this gamma influence naturally decays. As those positions roll off, the mechanical pressure that constrained price action may weaken, allowing price to move more freely.\n\nThis is not a directional prediction, but an explanation of market structure dynamics that can temporarily suppress volatility.\n\nNot financial advice. Educational discussion only.\n",

    "selftext": "Bitcoin has a tradition: Asia often sells almost any setups, while Europe frequently acts as a source of liquidity-driven bids. This time was no exception, however, right at expiration we got dumped and slightly fed some puts.\n\nBut still, I expected that we would hold above 88 with a daily ceiling around 89, however this scenario did not play out. The current morning setup looks bearish: the market not only stayed in the risk zone, but yesterday’s rally now more resembles a sweep.\n\nIV, in turn, remains low: the market is calm, participants do not believe in a drop.\n\nIn this context, it makes sense to take a closer look at DVOL behavior — attaching one screenshot:\n\nOn 15m (DVOL vs BTC) it’s visible that IV is suppressed from the very beginning of the recent chaotic movement which started on Sunday. Also separately noted is DVOL’s behavior starting from 00:00 NY yesterday.\n\nOn 4h (DVOL vs BTC) the current DVOL level is clearly seen in a broader context. Historically, this range often acted as a local low for volatility and frequently preceded further spikes in IV, especially during sell-off phases. At the same time, it is worth noting that a strong and sustained break and close below this level in the past was accompanied by an ATH update.\n\nSo, we can conclude that although the situation, as always, remains ambiguous, nevertheless we are indeed trading near key levels both for Bitcoin and for DVOL.\n\nSpecial attention deserves tomorrow’s expiration, for which the trading day will likely be adjusted. In options, puts dominate in terms of MV (x5 to calls), calls are gradually building up, but nevertheless 94 still looks like a naked, strong price attractor magnet.",

    "selftext": "Bitcoin has a tradition: Asia often sells almost any setups, while Europe frequently acts as a source of liquidity-driven bids. This time was no exception, however, right at expiration we got dumped and slightly fed some puts.\n\nBut still, I expected that we would hold above 88 with a daily ceiling around 89, however this scenario did not play out. The current morning setup looks bearish: the market not only stayed in the risk zone, but yesterday’s rally now more resembles a sweep.\n\nIV, in turn, remains low: the market is calm, participants do not believe in a drop.\n\nIn this context, it makes sense to take a closer look at DVOL behavior — attaching two screenshots:\n\nOn 15m (DVOL vs BTC) it’s visible that IV is suppressed from the very beginning of the recent chaotic movement which started on Sunday. Also separately noted is DVOL’s behavior starting from 00:00 NY yesterday.\n\nOn 4h (DVOL vs BTC) the current DVOL level is clearly seen in a broader context. Historically, this range often acted as a local low for volatility and frequently preceded further spikes in IV, especially during sell-off phases. At the same time, it is worth noting that a strong and sustained break and close below this level in the past was accompanied by an ATH update.\n\nSo, we can conclude that although the situation, as always, remains ambiguous, nevertheless we are indeed trading near key levels both for Bitcoin and for DVOL.\n\nSpecial attention deserves tomorrow’s expiration, for which the trading day will likely be adjusted. In options, puts dominate in terms of MV (x5 to calls), calls are gradually building up, but nevertheless 94 still looks like a naked, strong price attractor magnet.",

    "selftext": "If you're frustrated watching BTC bounce between $85k and $90k while the rest of the market rallies, you aren't alone. But this sideways price action isn't a sign of weakness—it’s a byproduct of market mechanics.\nFor most of December, we’ve been trapped in a \"Gamma Pin.\" There is a massive concentration of options sitting right at our current price levels. This forces market makers (dealers) to hedge their positions constantly:\n• As we dip toward $85k: Dealers have to buy to stay neutral.\n• As we push toward $90k: Dealers have to sell to stay neutral.\nThis creates an artificial ceiling and floor. It’s not that traders lack conviction; it’s that the \"Big Money\" is forced to keep the price in a box to manage their own risk. This is why we feel \"stuck\" even while gold and equities are hitting new highs.\nThat pressure is about to vanish. Roughly $27 billion in Bitcoin options are set to expire this week, wiping out over 50% of the total open interest in the market. Once that \"gamma pressure\" decays, the invisible walls at $85k and $90k disappear.\nHistorically, when this kind of artificial suppression ends during low volatility, the price snaps toward the direction of the heaviest positioning. Right now, positioning is heavily skewed toward Calls with strikes sitting significantly higher than current levels.\nThe range wasn’t distribution—it was containment. Once the expiration passes, the path of least resistance is up.\n#Bitcoin #Crypto",

If even a single wallet were compromised through **quantum computing**, the consequences would extend far beyond one holder, raising serious questions about **blockchain security**, privacy, and long term value.\n\nThis is exactly why **Serenity** has been preparing ahead of the curve. With sAxess and the upcoming sAxess Pro, we are actively working on the practical implementation of **quantum resistant encryption**, cryptographic approaches designed to remain secure even in a post quantum world. In simple terms, this means protecting private keys and **digital identity** with methods that do not rely on assumptions quantum machines are expected to break.\n\nReal **Web3 security** is not about reacting after damage is done. It is about building resilience early, before emerging risks become systemic threats.\n\nRead the full CoinDesk analysis here:  \n[coindesk.com/tech/2025/12/20/bitcoin-s-quantum-debate-is-resurfacing-and-markets-are-starting-to-notice](http://coindesk.com/tech/2025/12/20/bitcoin-s-quantum-debate-is-resurfacing-and-markets-are-starting-to-notice)\n\nDiscover how Serenity is building future ready crypto protection at  \n[s.technology](http://s.technology)\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/serenity-shield/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/serenity-shield/)",

    "selftext": "Is it just me or does it feel like we’re all kinda missing the bigger picture lately?  \nEveryone’s glued to charts, arguing about whether BTC runs another 10k or which bags might hit some crazy market cap. Meanwhile the real game feels like it’s happening somewhere else entirely.\n\nBig tech and big finance aren’t just trying to get involved in payments or crypto-adjacent stuff. They’re trying to own the pipes. The rails everything runs on. Every transaction, every data point, every tiny movement of money. If they pull that off, they don’t need to “win” a market, they just skim value off the entire system forever.\n\nThat’s what makes this feel like a turning point to me.\n\nOn one hand, crypto was supposed to mean decentralization, ownership, and actually giving regular people a shot. On the other hand, it kind feels like we might just be stress-testing the tech so the same players can rebuild the system, just more controlled this time.\n\nThe amount of value at stake here is massive. Trillions. And it’s either going to stay relatively open, or get quietly absorbed by a handful of platforms we already depend on for everything else.\n\nGenuinely curious how others see this do you think we’re actually pushing things in the right direction, or are we just early participants in something that ends up way more centralized than what we started with?",

While often described as “digital gold,” it still hasn’t fully earned the same treatment from institutions or sovereign players. At the same time, it’s not being priced as a pure growth or infrastructure asset either.\n\nHistorically, Bitcoin has tended to lag traditional hedges before making sharper moves later in the cycle. \nThis raises an interesting question: is Bitcoin being rejected by the market, or is this simply delayed repricing?\n\nCurious to hear how others here are interpreting this divergence.",

    "selftext": "This year’s price action sends a consistent signal. Investors are leaning toward assets they can physically hold, store, and depend on as confidence in financial systems erodes or as growth requires real-world build-out.\nGold has rallied amid rising concern over fiscal discipline, currency dilution, and geopolitical risk. Copper has advanced alongside the AI expansion, electrification, and global infrastructure investment. Both embody tangibility at a time when trust in abstractions is being tested.\nBitcoin, despite its framing as both digital gold and frontier technology, has failed to absorb either flow. ETF approval and regulatory clarity are largely absorbed, while sovereign buyers continue to default to gold as their primary hedge.\nThis gap does not imply fading relevance. Historically, gold often moves first during monetary strain, with Bitcoin responding later , and typically with sharper moves.\nThe market is not dismissing crypto.\nIt is asking for evidence, endurance, and the right moment.",

    "selftext": "Since the second half of November, Bitcoin has continued to trade within a narrow sideways range. The uncertainty surrounding the price trend was unaffected by the Fed meeting and high-profile regulatory relaxation. The SEC publicly refused to classify tokens and memecoins as securities, while the CFTC permitted the launch of prediction markets based on binary smart contracts with cryptocurrency bets.\n\nBitcoin is not yet perceived by the market as a “safe haven” asset, remaining in the high-risk category. In an environment of declining risk appetite, capital is flowing into bonds and metals, leaving digital currencies behind. \n\nCryptoQuant analytics confirm these negative dynamics: demand for the asset is falling and the SOPR indicator suggests that short-term holders are locking in losses, putting excessive pressure on any attempts at a rebound. \n\nWhile macroeconomic conditions throughout the year have supported the rise in the price of gold and silver, which is catching up with this trend, the internal structure of demand in the crypto market remains weak.\n\nThe lack of a functioning legislative framework in the US is limiting Bitcoin's movement. In the long term, there is a risk of cryptocurrencies being persecuted after Donald Trump's presidential term expires.",

    "title": "Tokenized US Treasuries just exploded since early 2024...now roughly a ~$9 billion market as institutions pile into onchain yield",
    "selftext": "This is one of those quiet revolutions happening in crypto that most people arent paying attention to. Tokenized US Treasury products have surged since early 2024 and are now roughly an ~$9 billion market depending on the tracker you look at. Some datasets frame it as a ~50x move from a very small base, while broader trackers show it was already closer to the ~$1B range in early 2024, so the multiple depends on what’s included. Either way, the direction is the same: big growth in a short time.\n\nBlackRock's BUIDL fund is leading the pack at around ~$1.7B in assets. Its basically short-term US government bonds that you can hold and settle onchain with daily yield. Other big players include Circle's USYC, Superstate's USTB and Ondo Finance's OUSG. All of them offering tokenized access to government debt through regulated structures.\n\nThe reason this matters is because US Treasury bills are perfect for bringing traditional finance onto blockchain. You get the safety of government backing combined with blockchain settlement efficiency. Plus institutions can use these as collateral for other activities which improves capital efficiency.\n\nMajor banks are already testing this stuff. DBS which is Southeast Asia's largest bank has piloted tokenized products and talked about using tokenized assets in institutional workflows like collateral management. This isnt some DeFi experiment anymore, its actual institutional infrastructure being built.\n\nThe timing makes sense too. With interest rates being higher than they've been in years, these products are offering decent yield compared to just holding stablecoins. And institutions get all the benefits of blockchain settlement without taking on crypto market risk.\n\nAnd as more portfolios hold yield-bearing assets on-chain...often across multiple wallets, chains, and structures...the operational side starts to matter too. Tracking yield, redemptions, and tax treatment across these instruments is where tools like Awaken Tax quietly become relevant, especially for funds and active investors managing both crypto-native and tokenized TradFi exposure.\n\nThis is basically tradfi and crypto merging in real time. When you see billions flowing into tokenized treasuries while the broader crypto market is struggling, it shows theres serious institutional demand for blockchain infrastructure even if they're not buying Bitcoin or ETH directly. Worth watching how this space develops in 2026.",

    "title": "5 charts suggest Bitcoin could enter bear market in early 2026...demand weakening across multiple indicators",
    "selftext": "Bitcoin's holding around $88-90K but the structure underneath looks pretty fragile. Multiple onchain and market indicators (as shown in CryptoQuant / SoSoValue-style charts) are pointing towards a late-cycle distribution phase which historically comes before bear markets start.\n\nFirst, Bitcoin's demand growth is rolling over. New buying pressure has been slowing even while price stayed elevated through 2025. When demand flattens but price stays high, thats usually when markets shift from accumulation to distribution.\n\nSecond, US spot Bitcoin ETF inflows are losing momentum. In 2024 they accelerated into year end but Q4 2025 shows them flattening and, in some periods, declining. These ETFs represent long-term institutional capital so when that slows down it removes a major support pillar.\n\nThird, dolphin wallets holding 100-1,000 BTC are reducing exposure. This cohort dropped sharply on a yearly basis similar to what happened in late 2021 before deeper drawdowns. These are sophisticated investors doing risk reduction.\n\nFourth, funding rates across exchanges are trending lower showing traders are less willing to pay to stay long. In bull markets you see rising funding and persistent long demand but thats not happening now.\n\nFifth and probably most significant, Bitcoin broke below the 365-day moving average for a sustained period. This level historically seperates bull from bear markets and previous tests in 2024-2025 didnt close below it.\n\nIf a full bear market develops, historical data points to Bitcoin's realized price around $56K as potential long-term support. Thats where the average cost basis of all holders sits. Doesnt mean it has to fall that far but its a reference point based on past cycles.\n\nFor investors, this is also where the unglamorous details start to matter...tracking partial sells, ETF-related exposure, or forced liquidations if leverage is involved. Tools like Awaken Tax tend to quietly become more relevant in these phases, when volatility turns “paper gains” into real taxable events.\n\nNone of these signals confirm a bear market alone but together they show rising downside risk heading into 2026. The margin for error is definitely shrinking.",

    "title": "Update: tried Coinbase, Bybit, Kast and Oobit",
    "selftext": "Alright so a while ago i asked yall about good cards for spending Bitcoin? Well i ended up trying out a few different options and figured id come back and share how its been going.\n\nSo i actually tested out Coinbase card first since its pretty popular and everyones heard of it. Its not bad but honestly the fees were kinda annoying and the whole process felt more clunky than i wanted. Just wasnt as smooth as i hoped it would be.\n\nThen i looked into Bybit card cause i already had an account there. Setup took forever though and honestly it felt like they were more focused on their exchange stuff than making payments easy. Just wasnt the vibe i was looking for.\n\nI also gave Kast a shot but ran into some issues with availability in my area and the support wasnt great when i had questions. Kinda gave up on that one pretty quick.\n\nFinally tried Oobit and honestly this is where i settled. Setup was way easier than the others, downloaded the app, connected my wallet, and basically was ready to go pretty quick. The interface is honestly not bad at all, way more straightforward than what i dealt with before.\n\nIve used it a few times now for actual purchases and its been working smooth. Literally just tap your phone like youre using Apple Pay or Google Pay and boom, payment goes through. The cashier doesnt even know youre paying with crypto which is kinda the point i guess. It just shows up as a regular card payment on their end.\n\nWhat i really like compared to the others is that theres no complicated conversion process or waiting around. You pay with your crypto and it handles everything instantly. The fees seem way more reasonable too compared to what Coinbase was charging me.\n\nI tested it at a coffee shop, grocery store, and online for some stuff and all of them worked without issues. Its actually pretty wild being able to spend your coins this easily in places that definitely dont accept crypto directly.\n\nOnly thing is you gotta have the app open and ready but thats not really a big deal. Battery usage hasnt been bad either if anyone was wondering about that.\n\nAnyway just wanted to update everyone since you guys helped me out with suggestions. Tried a bunch of options but Oobit ended up being the winner for me. If anyones still looking for an easy way to actually use their crypto for everyday stuff this ones been solid so far. Finally feels like were getting closer to that digital cash vision lol.",

    "title": "Why I wrote a supernatural thriller about Satoshi Nakamoto",
    "selftext": "Fiction can reach a truth that journalism cannot touch.\n\nI have taken the cold, hard math of the financial crisis, the fractional reserve banking and stripped away the sanitized euphemisms of Wall Street. In their place, I offer a visceral, supernatural thriller that suggests the \"vampire squid\" of finance isn't just a metaphor. It is a monster. And it is hungry.\n\nTo understand this book, you have to understand the emotional climate of 2008. It wasn't just about losing money; it was about a profound violation of trust. People felt, in their bones, that the system was rigged against them, that their lives were being harvested to keep a dying machine alive. I took that feeling, that collective psychic scream and gives it a face. I reimagined the birth of bitcoin not as a sterile coding project, but as a desperate, bloody act of self-defense.\n\nFor over a decade, the world has hunted for the real Satoshi, treating him as a mythical, omniscient deity. I dismantle that myth to build something far more compelling: a man. A terrified, socially anxious, physically vulnerable man who isn't trying to disrupt the bond market for glory, but is simply trying to save the people he loves from being crushed.\n\nMy story reframes the technical concept of \"Proof of Work\" from a computational necessity into a moral imperative. In a world where central bankers (and ancient cults, as it were) can print value out of thin air, I believe that true value can only come from sacrifice. From energy expended. From pain endured. The \"block\" is not just data; it is a shield against a predator that feeds on our helplessness.\n\nAs you read this, you will encounter ancient Babylon, Silicon Valley boardrooms, and the terrifying silence of the Redwood forests. But beneath the genre elements of occult rituals and high-stakes action lies a profound commentary on the nature of power.\n\nBirth of Bitcoin forces you to look at the reflection in the glass. It suggests that the creation of Bitcoin was the inevitable antibody generated by a sick system. \n\nWhether you are a Bitcoin maximalist or a staunch skeptic, this story demands that you witness the 2008 crisis not just as a failure of policy, but as a battle for the human spirit.\n\nWelcome to the Birth of Bitcoin. It is far bloodier than you remember.\n\nMy book releases on Jan 3, 2026 and you can buy it for $10 with Bitcoin.\nSend me a DM if you want to buy a copy.",

    "selftext": "When I first got interested in Bitcoin, I did what most people do - I watched price movements, read opinions, and tried to keep up with whatever narrative was trending that week. The problem was that none of it helped me actually understand what Bitcoin is or why it matters.\n\nAt some point I realized I was missing the foundation. I knew the terms, but not the logic behind them. Things like wallets, mining, decentralization, and security all felt fragmented instead of connected.\n\nI ended up reading Crypto for Dummies: A Beginner’s Guide to Bitcoin, Blockchain, and Not Losing Your Mind (or Your Money), and that’s when things finally clicked. What I appreciated is that it doesn’t assume you’re technical, but it also doesn’t oversimplify. It explains why Bitcoin was designed the way it was and how the pieces actually fit together.\n\nUnderstanding that:\n\n\t•\twallets don’t hold coins, they hold keys\n\n\t•\tmining is about securing the network, not just rewards\n\n\t•\tdecentralization is a design choice, not a buzzword\n\n\t•\tand why trust is replaced with verification\n\ncompletely changed how I view Bitcoin.\n\nI genuinely recommend Crypto for Dummies to anyone who feels like they’re “in” Bitcoin but still a bit confused by the fundamentals. It made the whole system feel logical instead of mysterious.",

    "selftext": "\nI finished reading Hijacking Bitcoin. My thoughts about it are mixed between amazement and disappointment due to the manipulation that various figures developed on it over time. I tried to read it in the most objective way possible, but it was difficult when seeing that the facts align with reality, and that everything is so well documented in conversations or posts that either no longer exist or were deliberately hidden to alter history.\n\nIt is impossible to see Bitcoin as a concept in the same way after reading the book. The situation has changed, and what exists today is far from what was once so innovative.\n\nIt would have been interesting to see how Bitcoin would have developed if the events described in the book had never materialized. At present, there are only two versions: the first, transformed into a shift in narrative away from the original purpose for which it was created, distorted into the promise—for some—of becoming millionaires. The second, turned into a future promise that is quite far from being the original Bitcoin, not because it cannot be, but because average people have already stopped believing in Bitcoin as a means of payment.\n\nIf only companies and platforms like Steam could accept Bitcoin again…\nAdoption would be taking place. Payment processors would have competition.\n\nIn the end, this is just a small opinion of mine. I plan to post many more as I examine the book in greater detail and dissect its inner workings in order to fully understand how and why the hijacking of Bitcoin occurred.",

    "selftext": "IOSG Ventures is framing this market as more “institutional accumulation” than a classic cycle top. Their founding partner Jocy basically says 2025 looks dark on the surface, but it’s also when the institutional era actually starts showing up.\n\nThey point to their own estimates here: institutions are now \\~24% of the market in their model, while retail has been a big source of selling pressure (they cite a \\~66% “exit” figure, but it’s worth reading that as their internal read, not an official stat).\n\nPrice-wise, BTC is roughly down \\~6% YTD, but it still printed an all-time high around $126,080 back on Oct 6, 2025. So the vibes can feel bearish while the structure underneath is changing.\n\nTiming-wise, IOSG thinks the first half of 2026 could be a “honeymoon period” (midterms aren’t until November), so less political headline whiplash early on. They throw out ranges too: next 3–6 months $87k–$95k, and first half of 2026 $120k–$150k.\n\nand if this “institutions accumulate during weakness” idea is right, it usually means more churn for everyone else in the meantime. more rotations, more small trades, maybe some yield stuff. that’s where the boring tools matter. something like awaken tax is useful just to keep your cost basis and reporting clean, so you’re not guessing later when you’re trying to make sense of a messy year.\n\nOne more fix: the “$25B inflows” point is more accurately **IBIT alone** in 2025, not all Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nNot financial advice, just cleaning up the framing.",

    "selftext": "So we just watched [Ethereum ETFs dump over $600M in a single week](https://www.mexc.co/en-NG/news/312689?utm_source=perplexity), BlackRock's ETHA alone hemorrhaged $467M. Bitcoin's not much better, BTC is down 5% this week, ETH down 9%. The kicker? These are supposed to be the \"mature investors\" bringing stability to crypto.\n\nHere's what's frustrating me about this whole institutional adoption narrative. Traditional finance players are trying to force-fit legacy infrastructure onto blockchain rails. They're dealing with the same back-office nightmares, settlement delays, and fee structures that existed before crypto even existed. Then they wonder why institutional capital is so flighty when markets get choppy.\n\nI've been researching what actual institutional-grade blockchain infrastructure looks like beyond just wrapped ETFs, and there's a massive gap between what exists and what's actually needed. Real institutions need 24/7 markets (not just crypto market hours), atomic settlement (not T+2), and significantly lower costs than what TradFi offers.\n\nBeen following a project called Sphinx Protocol that's trying to tackle this for commodity derivatives specifically (oil, gas, futures, options). They raised $2M pre-seed back in June and are currently in their pre-testnet phase with mainnet supposedly coming later next year. The angle is building a permissioned L1 specifically for energy commodities with institutional compliance baked in from day one, not bolted on after.\n\nWhat caught my eye is they're claiming 10x lower fees and 28% better capital efficiency vs traditional exchanges, plus atomic settlement. Big promises obviously, and ngl I'm skeptical until testnet actually drops, but at least someone's trying to build proper infrastructure instead of just another token wrapper. If blockchain can't dramatically improve the actual trading infrastructure and just becomes another wrapper for the same old system, what's the point? We need better plumbing, not more speculation on broken pipes.\n\nAnyone else watching infrastructure plays in the commodity/derivatives space? Feels like this is where the real institutional adoption could actually happen if someone gets it right.",

    "title": "Introducing Orivon, the ultimate Browser Web3 (concept)",
    "selftext": "In the last months I've been into the idea of building a *truly web3* Browser, I've been delighted discovering that my developing and web3 knowledge was enough to work on this important missing piece, and now I think im close to the perfect design for a truly web3 browsing system of the future\n\nOne of first the problems for web3 mass adoption are absence of easyness and cleariness, peoples has no clue what is web3 and what's not (see FTX case on public opinion), using it is actually hard for common people and most doesn't understand it's value and uses, furthermore, the one most us uses is not the actual trustless web3, but a trusted web2.5 temporary solution.\n\nAs right now there are some tested ways to access a \"web3\" in a trustless manner, like IPFS, Decentralized DNS, or accessing specific protocols by installing some sort of programs (ex. Bisq, Atomic swaps, Nodes).  \nCurrenly normal Browsers limitations prevents running most of web3 things on-the-fly\n\nBy an user perspective, everything is disconnected, nothing provides a clear web3 experience worth of the big public attention\n\nBut it's understandable, technologies takes a while until *a way* to make them easly accessible is found, Orivon proposes to be *the way*.\n\nTechnical implementation and details can be found here: [https://orivonstack.com/t/orivon-project-implementation-and-details/8](https://orivonstack.com/t/orivon-project-implementation-and-details/8)\n\nDown below are the basic pointers of this project, please note that's a simple showcase worth of feedbacks, I omitted a lot of things to keep it simple:\n\n**Deeper API's for JS and Wasm** enabling developers to build and port any web3 Program as Website, keeping it trustless. It's a bit technical, but it includes giving sites/apps controlled access of raw network, sandboxed filesystem, and other features inspired from WASI, so that everything could be ran locally and safely by simply opening a site page: bitcoin node, monero node, atomic swaps, Bisq, or any other protocol. A game-changer for both users and developers\n\n**Applications**, almost every component is possibily extended by an App: DNS resolution (ENS), Site Data Gathering(IPFS, Arweave), Account (mnemonic, hardware wallet or anything else by any App logic), Wallet (Ex. Extensor app implementing a new crypto like Monero, or vanity ethereum addresses), Network (ex. an app for Bitcoin network support, IPFS network, Bisq pricenode) user may create it right away a node from a single panel.  \nImagine Monero, or Bisq tokens if could be connected to DApps, again, a goldmine for developers and users\n\n**Domain Data Ownership Confirmation (DDOC),** it can be seen as an additional security layer for Web3 after HTTPS, it server to verify that the data you received are exactly what the domain owner wanted you to receive, happens by verifying hashes against DNS Records  \nIn Web2 that wouldn't make sense, because a lot of sites want to be dynamic, but for Web3 the core of sites will be always static and predictable\n\n**Trustlessity and Security score** for websites and apps: \"Is this site trustless?\" If it's a .com site it's *not* trustless, if it's a .eth connected to IPFS *yes*, but if it gives you a bank IBAN to receive money without informing the user about the non-trustlessity of it, it's *not* trustless. If without user control it relies on data from centralized parties, it's *not* trustless, simple as that.\n\nYou can't tell if something is trustless or web3 until you read into the code of what you are using, most peoples are not going to do it personally, so instead they can trust \"someone\" giving a valutation of trustlessity for you, and if this \"someone\" is an enough decentralized web3 DAO, it's almost perfect.\n\nBig public needs an easy way to feel safe especially in the web3 world, to know if what they're using is actually web3 or web2.5, we should give them a good sense of security, that's why showing a Trustlessity and Security score is so important for apps, websites and operations.\n\nYou need to know if a smart contract puts trust on a central autority (WBTC) or it's trustless (TBTC), futhermore you need to know the safety of it, maybe you can yeld some stablecoin trustlessly for 400% annual income, but it doesn't mean it's safe\n\n**Web3 Store**, a place where you can easly find for Web3 compliant apps, ready to be installed and ran locally, or to implement new components into the Browser, everything in a trustless manner. Of course, the Web3 Store itself is an app, freely changable with any other community App (Technically every website will be installable and integrable as App, it's up to you to decide to install and integrate it on your browser or not)\n\n**Desktop and Mobile cross-compatibility**, at least for apps/integrations\n\nOrivon aims to be a free and open space to connect every developer and user, a simple and unified way of connecting things that could bring web3 to it's most brightest form ever\n\nI made this post intentionally with hyperbole claims in hope to provoke a constructive discussion about this topic and engage efforts from experts and people like you to improve the web3 ecosystem and user experience as much as possible. The big effort of convincing dapps/devs into the Orivon way has yet to begin, in the long run i'm hoping to end up with extensive ongoing discussions about every part of Orivon and eventally make it real",

    "selftext": "Asking as a long time horizon investor who is new to the Bitcoin paradigm. I just recently bought into BTC over late November to this month with an average cost basis for BTC is around 90k, I have very strong conviction in BTC so it compromises around 70% of my current portfolio. I have some cash left to invest which would bring it to around 85%, however I’m thinking about putting that 15% into a DAT like MSTR. However MSTR is a pretty complicated product and I don’t know all the ins and outs of it.\n\nI have the basic concept and like the idea of a higher reward for taking on the counter party risk or an amplified bet on BTC performance, but in general wondering if others here also invest in these bitcoin backed companies or your thoughts on them. Also wondering if I should purchase MSTR now given BTC price (is the bottom in) or if I should wait to see if it drops more.",

    "title": "Did Bitcoin Gain Institutional Demand But Lost Its Coolness Factor?",
    "selftext": "From the very beginning I never wanted institutions in Bitcoin. Never wanted ETFs. Never wanted options or Blackstone or index funds involved. I appreciated Michael Saylor for his great explanations and I thought putting MSTR's cash into Bitcoin was brilliant. But I did not want his new financial \"products\" nor what that company has become recently. I don't want Treasury companies. I sure as heck did not want nations owning it. I knew one day all this would probably happen, but never really felt it would help Bitcoin adoption and might even hinder it.\n\nEssentially, I've always believed every Bitcoin owned by a government or company or institution was one less Bitcoin that could be owned by PEOPLE. Furthermore, although it was obvious all this institutional interest would drive some demand, it seemed to me that for every institutional dollar of demand, Bitcoin would lose at least one dollar of demand from human beings who liked its outsider status, coolness, privacy and the fact institutions were not involved. Has this change happened?\n\nFor all the hullabaloo, Bitcoin has gained only 72% the last 4 years, as of today. That's certainly not bad, but in the same period gold has gained 132%. I worry the number of Bitcoins held in private wallets has probably peaked already and most future demand will be via \"trusted third parties\", which seems to defeat the whole point, doesn't it?\n\nI guess my question is, now that Bitcoin has been adopted as another asset category by the rich and powerful... will it just become....just another asset?",

    "selftext": "Hey peeps! I’ve been keeping an eye on The Musk Token lately, and I’m curious to hear what others think about it. From what I’ve seen, it seems to have some unique features that set it apart from other tokens.\nOne thing that really stands out is its fairness-focused design. Unlike many projects, there are no whales able to hoard massive amounts, which seems to create a more balanced and community-driven ecosystem. The 1:10 ratio from $GREAT also caught my attention, making initial participation feel accessible.\nOn top of that, The Musk Token has shown a bullish performance on CoinMarketCap, which adds some confidence for early adopters. The project also emphasizes transparency and community involvement, which isn’t always the case with newer tokens.\nI’m wondering if anyone here has actually used or invested in it. How’s your experience been in terms of stability, growth, and general community vibes? Do you think it has long-term potential compared to other crypto projects out there?\nWould love to hear your thoughts, opinions, or even skepticism, trying to get a well-rounded perspective before deciding to dive deeper.",

    "selftext": "Today’s BCH meetup wasn’t fancy.\n\nNo drinks, no sponsored venue, no extras. I decided to host it in my own backyard, and from preparation to wrap-up it took around 3 hours of my time.\n\nWe were 4 participants (5 including myself). Small group — but real attention, real questions, and real engagement.\nDuring the meetup, we talked about:\n\n- Bitcoin Cash as peer-to-peer decentralized digital money\n- How to use BCH, receive BCH, and store value with BCH\n- BCH wallets, with Paytaca highlighted as the first one (we’ll go deeper into others in future meetups)\n\nWhat mattered most to me was the reaction. After the presentation, I could already feel acceptance and curiosity from some of the participants. This wasn’t about price or speculation — it was about understanding BCH as a tool people can actually use.\n\nIt was a very pleasant Saturday, emotional in a good way, and exactly how peer-to-peer money should be discussed: real use, by real people, in a real place.\nMore photos and videos will be shared in upcoming articles and posts.\n\nI also plan to continue organizing these meetups — even if I have to cover the costs myself.\n\nIn the end, BCH wins.\n(More photos and videos in a full article soon)",

Because just looking on the graphs doesn't bring me forward to my goals, to be successful day trader and make it as my main income or as a \"part time job\" after work. I see my potential in crypto currency's cuz I already did 300k$ from the bitcoin when it reached the 110k the first time after trump won.

    "selftext": "Small caps and large caps in Humanoids: watch out for takeoff! We've favored small caps because with falling interest rates and the upcoming QE, they'll be the stars of 2026.\n\n🏅🏅🏅 Realbotix (XBOTF) – AI and robotics humanoids\nCurrent market capitalization: ~$55–65M (OTC) approximately. Realbotix is ​​the only listed small-cap humanoid in the world, with a significant undervaluation. Furthermore, the presence of Arthur Hayes raises questions, as he, who anticipated Bitcoin before anyone else, may have sensed a jackpot with Realbotix, which could behave like a meme multiplied by 100.\n\nNotable shareholders: Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX and a prominent figure in the Bitcoin world, holds approximately 15-16% of the capital (approximately 32.2 million shares, $10 million), bringing a renowned investor to the project.\n\nThe former AI director at Google has been on the board of directors since October 2025.\n\nRealbotix targets social humanoids and is expected to diversify into home services.\nIndicative robot prices: basic approx. ~$10,000, premium ~$25,000, enterprise ~$50,000 (illustrative).\nSimulated future valuation (hypothetical):\n• 100k units → Revenue ~$2 billion → Potential market cap ~$10–40 billion;\n\n• 1M units → Revenue ~$20 billion → Market cap ~$50–200 billion+;\n\n• 10M units → Revenue ~$200 billion → Market cap ~$300–800 billion+;\n\n• 100M units → Revenue ~$2 trillion → Market cap &gt;$1 trillion.\n\nUpcoming catalysts: new humanoid robots unveiled at CES, diversification into home services, Aria operational with a market option to follow, approximately $10 million in cash/crypto for ~2 years of non-dilutive operation, and announcements of imminent non-dilutive strategic partnerships with two major US companies, according to the CEO (corporate communication).\n\nIts starting value should be around $1 billion when you see Figure AI at $39.5 billion or others at $2 billion or $10 billion without having sold any robots, while Realbotix has already sold five times its original value in one year, and for example, has a European partnership with Grupo Ruo.\n\n\n🏅🏅 Vishay Precision Group (VPG) – Sensors &amp; Measurement for Robotics\nVPG, a specialist in sensor and measurement technologies, is benefiting from growing interest related to automation and the need for sensors for advanced robots (including Optimus). Its market capitalization (~$500 million) reflects a solid small cap with revenue of ~$300 million and improved margins. Hypothetical robotics revenue simulation: if VPG captures a share of the components in 100,000 robots → ~$50–100 million; 1 million → ~$500 million; 10M → ~$5B; 100M → ~$50B.\nIndicative US prices: stock ~$30–40 (varies), sensor components ~$100–1,000+ per system (illustrative).\n\nVPG may be the only US small-cap stock with such a high market capitalization. The market hasn't seen VPG yet; it's under the radar and has never exploded. But it's going to give us a QBTS in 2026! In anticipation!! VPG will be the first to see its orders explode exponentially!\n\n\nCap of 5B by 2026 will be its destination 10/15B by 2027/28\n\n🏅 RichTech Robotics (RR) – Autonomous Robotics\nRichTech is a small autonomous robot company offering robot-as-a-service (RaaS) solutions. Its services + hardware model allows it to target strong growth if its solutions become widespread in the logistics/industrial sectors.\nRevenue Simulation: 100k robots at ~$30,000 → ~$3 billion; 1M → ~$30 billion; 10M → ~$300 billion; 100M → ~$3 trillion.\nIndicative US prices: autonomous robot ~$20,000–$50,000 (estimated, depending on configuration).\n\n\nMicroVision (MVIS) – LiDAR and Autonomous Perception\nMVIS provides LiDAR solutions for autonomous vehicles and AR/VR, crucial for robotic navigation.

    "selftext": "Grayscale was the first company to launch a proxy instrument for institutional Bitcoin investments. Demand for GBTC trust shares was enormous, far exceeding the price of BTC.\n\nConsequently, the Bitcoin capitalisation in Grayscale's vault was 40% lower than the value of the shares. A similar situation initially developed at MicroStrategy (now Strategy). For a long period, the company's shares traded at a premium to its accumulated Bitcoin.\n\nIn February 2021, the GBTC premium turned into a discount. This was the main signal of the impending crypto winter. Today, MSTR is rapidly losing its market premium. \nFor the first time in a long while, the stock price has fallen to a level that corresponds to the actual value of the company's Bitcoin reserves.\n\nAs in 2021, investors are no longer willing to overpay for shares as a means of owning cryptocurrency. However, this is not just a sign of crypto winter.  \n\nGBTC lost its appeal due to the emergence of Bitcoin ETFs. It seems that companies accumulating BTC are also no longer of interest to investors.",

    "title": "Peter Brandt says Clarity Act wont move Bitcoin's price much - already priced in according to analysts",
    "selftext": "Veteran trader Peter Brandt is throwing cold water on expectations that the US Clarity Act will pump Bitcoin prices. The next near-term milestone is a Senate committee markup in January (per White House crypto czar David Sacks), but Brandt’s saying it’s not gonna be “world-shaking” for BTC.\n\nHis take is pretty straightforward. Yeah the regulation is needed and will be good for the industry overall, but having an asset get regulated isnt some earth-shattering event. Especially when alot of Bitcoin maxis never wanted regulation in the first place. He thinks it’ll clarify the regulatory structure which is positive but wont redefine Bitcoin’s value.\n\nJohn Glover from Ledn agrees and says the Clarity Act has already been priced into the market. Any benefits to price action would be more delayed over time as Bitcoin and ETH gain broader acceptance as investable assets. So dont expect fireworks on day one.\n\nThe more interesting part is Brandt’s price prediction. He believes Bitcoin is currently in a bear market and could trade down to $60,000 in Q3 2026. Thats a 31% drop from current levels around $88,000. He says the charts are suggesting this move but his downside bias is “moderate” because of stuff like the Clarity Act providing some support.\n\nSenator Cynthia Lummis has been pushing hard to advance the bill and mentioned the crypto industry was getting concerned about progress since drafts kept changing during bipartisan discussions. The bill addresses digital asset market structure which is important long-term even if it doesnt create immediate price action.\n\nAnd honestly, if the vibe shifts from “number go up” to “rules + reporting,” that’s where people get caught off guard. Not because regulation instantly pumps price, but because it nudges more activity onto cleaner rails. If you’re actively trading or doing DeFi, it’s also the moment where keeping your cost basis straight matters more than ever, and tools like Awaken tax become less “nice to have” and more “please don’t let me guess my taxes.”\n\nSo basically temper your expectations if you’re expecting the Clarity Act to moon Bitcoin.",

    "selftext": "\n\nThe Bank of Japan raised its policy rate to 0.75%. Formally, this is negative for risk assets - yet the market moved higher. The reason is simple: the hike was fully priced in, with markets assigning a ~98% probability to this outcome. What really mattered wasn’t the decision itself, but the tone.\n\nThe BOJ Governor signaled that further tightening will continue - but very slowly and cautiously.\n\nThis eased fears of an abrupt unwinding of the yen carry trade, where cheap yen funding is deployed into higher-yielding assets, including crypto.\n\nEarlier in December, many expected a BOJ hike to push $BTCbelow $70k due to liquidity tightening. Instead, the market did the opposite - the negative was absorbed in advance.\n\nThe takeaway remains unchanged: liquidity and expectations matter far more than the headline decisions of central banks.",

    "title": "Do We Need a Blockchain Optimized Specifically for Social Data?",
    "selftext": "Most existing blockchains were not designed with social data as a first-class use case. Bitcoin optimizes for immutability and security, Ethereum for general-purpose computation, and newer L2s for throughput and cost efficiency. But social platforms have very different technical requirements: extremely high write frequency, low-value but high-volume data, mutable or revocable content, complex social graphs, and near-instant UX expectations. This raises a serious question: are we trying to force social systems onto infrastructure that was never meant for them, or is there a genuine need for a blockchain (or protocol layer) optimized specifically for social data?\n\nFrom a technical perspective, social data stresses blockchains in unique ways. Posts, comments, reactions, and edits generate continuous state changes, many of which have low long-term value but high short-term relevance. Storing all of this on-chain is expensive and often unnecessary, yet pushing everything off-chain weakens verifiability, portability, and user ownership. Current approaches hybrid models using IPFS, off-chain indexes, or app-controlled databases solve scalability but reintroduce trust assumptions that blockchains were meant to remove. This tension suggests that the problem is not just scaling, but data semantics: social data is temporal, contextual, and relational, unlike financial state.\n\nThere’s also the issue of the social graph. Following relationships, reputation signals, and interaction histories form dense, evolving graphs that are expensive to compute and verify on general-purpose chains. Indexing layers can help, but they become de facto intermediaries. A chain or protocol optimized for social use might prioritize native graph operations, cheap updates, and verifiable yet pruneable history features that are not priorities in today’s dominant chains.\n\nThat said, creating a “social blockchain” is not obviously the right answer. Fragmentation is a real risk, and specialized chains often struggle with security, developer adoption, and long-term sustainability. It’s possible that the solution is not a new L1, but new primitives: standardized social data schemas, portable identities, verifiable off-chain storage, and execution environments where feed logic and moderation rules are user-defined rather than platform-defined. In that sense, the missing layer may be protocol-level social infrastructure, not another chain.\n\nI’m curious how others here see this trade-off. Are current chains fundamentally misaligned with social workloads, or is this a tooling and architecture problem we can solve on top of existing ecosystems? And if we were to design infrastructure specifically for social data, what properties would actually justify it at the protocol level rather than the application level?",

    "selftext": "The first and most obvious sign that Bitcoin is about to be sold off is the policy of global central banks. While everyone is waiting for the outcome of the Bank of Japan's meeting — whose rate hikes have always coincided with a 20% drop in BTC prices — pay attention to Europe.\n\nThe central banks of the European Union, Norway and Sweden have frozen rates, and the tightening of monetary policy is beginning to take on the characteristics of a global trend. The Federal Reserve's head has also hinted at a freeze, and Australia and China are extending theirs too.\n\nThe second signal is on-chain characteristics. The average size of BTC deposits on the Binance exchange grew from 12 BTC in November to 37 BTC by 18–19 December. This indicates that large investors (\"whales\") are actively transferring coins to exchanges for sale. \n\nFrom a technical analysis perspective, the decline on the weekly chart is accelerating, as confirmed by increased trading volumes. This could help the bears break through the strong support zone of $90k–$80k.\nThe upward trend was definitively broken when the psychological mark of $100K was broken through. Bitcoin will only find buyers at the 'Trump level' of around $60K, where the cryptocurrency's pre-election rally began.\n\nThe US President has failed to deliver on his promises to establish a clear legislative framework for the regulation and circulation of digital assets. The Senate has postponed the adoption of the main law, and if there are no clear signs of change by January, I expect the above scenario to play out.",

    "title": "The first time I used a crypto-backed loan.... it felt like cheating.",
    "selftext": "Last winter I tried a crypto-backed loan because I didn’t want to sell my coins. I locked up about $10,000 worth of BTC and borrowed $5,500 cash. The app called that “55% LTV”. All it means is: loan divided by collateral value.\n\nThe terms said a warning would hit around 70% and an auto-sell could happen around 80%. I read it, nodded, and moved on. Big mistake. Because the math changes fast when price drops.\n\nThat night BTC slid hard. My $10,000 collateral became roughly $7,800 in a few hours. My loan was still $5,500, so my LTV jumped to about 70%+. I got a message: “margin call, 24 hours to cure.” Cure means add more collateral or repay part of the loan.\n\nI tried adding $1,000 more BTC from another wallet. Network fees were spiking and my transfer sat pending. I tried repaying $500 instead, but my bank transfer wouldn’t clear instantly. Support chat replied like “high volume, expect delays.” The timer didn’t care.\n\nBy morning the app showed “partial liquidation executed.” They sold a chunk of my BTC to push the ratio back down, then charged an execution fee on what they sold. I wasn’t wiped out, but I did sell at the worst moment without choosing to.\n\nIf you ever use these loans, assume a 30% drop can happen any random day. Borrow lower than you think, keep extra collateral ready, and make sure you can move money fast.",

    "selftext": "Brazil’s largest private bank, Itaú Unibanco, recently suggested that investors consider a small Bitcoin allocation (around 1–3%) as part of a diversified portfolio.\n\nWhat’s interesting is the framing: this isn’t positioned as a speculative trade or a high-conviction bet, but rather as a hedge — particularly against currency risk and macro uncertainty. The recommendation comes after continued weakness in the Brazilian real, with Bitcoin viewed as a non-sovereign asset that behaves differently from local equities and bonds.\n\nItaú also referenced regulated access via a local Bitcoin ETF (BITI11), highlighting how institutions increasingly prefer structured vehicles over direct self-custody.\n\nThis mirrors a broader trend we’ve seen globally: Bitcoin being discussed less as a “trade” and more as a portfolio component, especially in emerging markets facing FX volatility.\n\nCurious how others here think about this:\nDo small BTC allocations (1–3%) meaningfully improve risk-adjusted returns, or is this mostly narrative management by institutions?",

About **1.7 million BTC** are already in addresses where public keys are exposed, making them vulnerable once quantum computers arrive. Moving coins to quantum-safe outputs isn’t automatic.\n\nTechnical risks are real, and governance challenges make a smooth migration uncertain. Quantum computing could strengthen Bitcoin, or it could challenge the whole network in far greater ways than we anticipate.",

I've seen it couple times and I really like the idea behind crypto, I think it's just a very smart trick which allows for a payment system which doesn't require trust. \nLately I've been exploring polymarket and implementing some systematic strategies there and I came across a problem which requires direct interactions with Blockchain rather than just calling functions from API. This got me more interested in the topic. Today I searched for videos on yt with 'Distrivuted ledger technology ' and I only found very basic videos.\nSooo, what yt channels or websites would you recommend to someone who is pretty new to the concept but has descent technical knowledge?

    "selftext": "I’m holding **1 BTC and 7 ETH** right now. The market looks brutal, sentiment is crushed, and everywhere you look people are losing hope. But this is exactly what cycles do  they squeeze emotions until most give up.\n\nThe truth is, conviction isn’t built when charts are green. It’s built when everything feels hopeless, when headlines scream “crypto is dead,” and when fear makes you want to walk away. That’s the moment patience matters most.\n\nBTC and ETH have survived every crash, every capitulation, every wave of disbelief. They remain the backbone of this space. Prices today feel like doom, but in hindsight they’ll be remembered as opportunity.\n\nI’m not panicking. I’m holding. Because sentiment always flips and when it does, those who stayed through the storm will be the ones rewarded",

    "title": "The Senate Stole Bitcoin’s Santa Rally",
    "selftext": "This week's vote on a key bill to regulate the cryptocurrency market has been officially postponed by the US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. The committee's Republican chairman, Tim Scott, decided to postpone consideration of the issue until early 2026.\n\nHis spokesperson, Jeff Naft, confirmed that progress had been made in developing a bipartisan agreement, but that negotiations with Democratic colleagues were ongoing. Initially, the committee chairman insisted that the bill should only be passed if there was consensus, in order to ensure maximum clarity for the digital asset industry and consolidate the US's position as a global crypto hub.\n\nThe vote was postponed due to requests from Democrats, who needed more time to discuss controversial issues. Consequently, the decisive stage in the formation of the legislative framework for digital assets in the US, which was anticipated this week, has been delayed, leaving the industry to continue operating in a state of regulatory uncertainty until next year.\n\nThe market reacted to the news with a drop of around 5%. The chances of a Santa Claus rally for Bitcoin are now zero. Cryptocurrencies will not grow in January until the Senate votes on the bill, which has now been postponed six times.",

    "selftext": "I keep seeing two extreme takes about quantum computers and crypto.\n\nOne side says quantum will break Bitcoin overnight and everything goes to zero. While the other side says It’s 50 years away, ignore it. \n\nSo I want to ask a more realistic question. At what point does the quantum threat become practically dangerous, not just academically interesting?\n\nI want to know when a quantum machine can derive a private key fast enough from a public key already revealed on chain before the network can react or users can move funds\n\nFrom what I understand the current machines are not strong enough and nowhere near this\n\nYou’d need fault-tolerant qubits at massive scale\n\nBreaking ECDSA once in a lab isn’t the same as breaking it reliably on live networks. So here’s what I’m genuinely curious about. \n\nWhat’s the earliest realistic timeline where this becomes a real threat? What would be the first visible warning sign? Are legacy wallets and reused addresses the real ticking time bomb here? Or is that overstated fear? Lastly do you think Bitcoin will upgrade before it’s necessary or only when pressure forces it?\n\nI’m not trying to spread FUD.\n\nI actually think this is one of the few long term risks crypto can plan for if we’re honest about timelines.\n\nCurious to hear thoughts from people who’ve actually looked into quantum hardware cryptography or protocol-level upgrades",

    "selftext": "So last week was eyeing btc to break above 94k  due to my analysis and close above due to some key areas from the 4hr timeframe and above which didnt happen so i was wrong about that. Did want btc to clear some longs at 89k but was hoping it would do that first then go higher. Currently btc is ranging while creating wicks to the upside. Theres a chance btc hits 86k area to tap a trendline. Then reverse. If by the end of the month btc doesn't retest 100k area I believe we'll se under 80k again and lower.  If btc closes around 100k by the end of the month we could see some more bullish strength in January. Dont think btc will make new highs before another correction but won't rule it out either.\n\nand for my Eth traders ideally breaking 33-3400 would be the goal otherwise we could see 2700-2600\n\nBtc is still in an overall bullish trend on the higher timeframes. Will it stay bullish only time will tell based on the next 2 weeks.\n\nHows people's portfolios looking did anyone capture the lows of btc and alts around 80k or did you jump in after a sizeable pump and are now in small profits or drawdown?",

Aiming for long-term portfolio diversification, sovereign wealth funds and the region's wealthiest family offices have begun an aggressive expansion into digital assets.\n\n The key difference in this wave is the exclusive use of regulated channels, such as spot ETFs, rather than risky purchases on conventional crypto exchanges.\n\nAbu Dhabi has become a financial centre of attraction, boasting ideal infrastructure for institutional investors. The Abu Dhabi Investment Council's decision to increase its holdings in BlackRock's IBIT fund is indicative of this trend. \n\nThis influx of 'smart money' not only pushes prices up, but also improves the market qualitatively: the order book grows deeper, spreads narrow and pricing becomes more efficient. \n\nHowever, experts warn of the risks associated with such popularity: while institutional capital provides stability, it retains the ability to exit instantly and en masse through the same ETFs, creating the threat of sharp declines when global market sentiment changes.",

Your guess must end with two zeros.**\n6. **Included with your guess must be the instruction \"higher\" or \"lower\". If your guess has already been entered, your guess will be moved to the next available slot, higher or lower, based on your instruction. (If you guess $85300, but $85300 is already taken, I will move your guess to the next available slot, based on your \"higher or lower\".)**\n7.

    "selftext": "Earlier this week the SEC gave DTCC the green light to tokenize Russell 1000 stocks, Treasuries, and ETFs starting H2 2026. Not sure why this isn't bigger news, but this is legitimately the infrastructure moment we've been waiting for.\n\nRight now if an institution wants to trade stocks and crypto together, they're dealing with a mess. T+2 settlement on stocks means you're stuck waiting 2 days, T+0 on crypto means instant, completely different risk systems, and you've got counterparty risk on both sides. It's inefficient as hell.\n\nIn short, in 2026 everything moves on-chain. T+0 settlement. Single margin pool. One ledger.\n\nYeah, this doesn't pump Bitcoin tomorrow. But it does mean the institutional capital sitting on the sidelines waiting for \"real infrastructure\" now has an actual date on the calendar. H2 2026 is when serious volume starts moving on-chain. If you understand why institutions are moving to DeFi, you're going to be ahead of most people in 2026. It's not really about lower fees. It's about actually being able to settle instantly and run your capital efficiently. Once you can cross-margin Russell 1000 stocks against commodities against crypto with instant settlement? That's when institutions actually move real volume.\n\nThe thing nobody's talking about:\n\nThe protocols actually building for this stuff now—institutional settlement infrastructure, real asset trading—are positioning themselves for what's coming. Most DeFi is built for retail traders. For example, Sphinx Protocol (a commodities-on-chain project still in development) is building exactly this kind of infrastructure: T+0 atomic settlement and cross-margining for institutions. There's a quiet wave of projects that started building on this thesis months ago, and now with this SEC news, their timing looks prescient.\n\nKeep an eye on how tokenization develops in H2 2026. This is the real story everyone's sleeping on.\n",

First it was issues with high fees and a congested network. Then the L2s came and gave some hope. But the whole ecosystem is a mess.\n\nI invested in Polkadot a while ago. So long ago that I paid over $20 for each DOT. As a dev, I wanted to learn about building on Polkadot but found it totally overwhelming. So my attention drifted away. Earlier this year I saw Doom running on JAM and knew I needed to see what what going on.\n\nI took the PBAX course and started learning about Polkadot. Wow. They are so far ahead of Ethereum and their roadmap is bright and shiny. I'm still learning about JAM, which is sort of an abstraction of parts of Polkadot upon which any blockchain networks can run. And it's technically as powerful as a super computer.\n\nThere are now more active developers in the Polkadot space than in the Ethereum space. The way I figure it, most people won't care about why Polkadot is important until developers start to produce applications. And it seems a giant herd of developers are moving in exactly that direction right now. I'm learning INK myself with plans to port an old project over. And I don't really expect anyone who's in the scene just to invest and make money to notice until late next year. And then - I think it's going to explode.\n\nI have moved about 80% of my ETH holdings to DOT, which is trading close to $2 now. We'll see if my intuition about Polkadot is as accurate as it was about Ethereum and Bitcoin. ",

    "selftext": "With just under a day left until the $US Launchpool on Bitget comes to an end, it feels like a good moment to pause and reflect rather than promote. This year has been defined by uncertainty across the crypto market. Prices moved quickly, sentiment shifted often and staying grounded wasn’t always easy. In the middle of all that noise, experiences like this stood out for a different reason.\n\nLocking BGB for a short period wasn’t about chasing quick gains or timing the market perfectly. It was more about choosing patience and consistency in a space that often rewards impatience. While major assets like BTC continued to fluctuate, the value of a calmer, more structured approach became clearer over time. Small, steady rewards added up, not just financially, but in confidence and discipline.\n\nWhat made this experience meaningful wasn’t the size of the returns, but the lesson behind them. It reinforced the idea that sustainable progress often happens quietly, without hype. As the year comes to a close, this feels like a fitting way to wrap things up, not with dramatic moves, but with measured decisions and reflection. Sometimes, ending the year on a stable note is the real win, setting the tone for approaching the next one with clarity and intention.\n\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/talus-network/",

It won’t stop you from sending, but at least you’re not going in blind.\n\nStill early and very much a work in progress, but I’m curious — would a shared username + pre-send safety check actually make crypto transfers less stressful for you, or is this solving a problem you’ve already learned to live with?",

As a dev, I participated in grants and hackathons. Then I discovered Stacks (back when it was Blockstack) and joined their App Mining program.\n\nThe program paid well. Really well. Enough-to-retire well.\n\nBut I didn't cash out enough. I held most of it.\n\n**The delusion**\n\nStacks has this mechanism where you stack STX to earn BTC. Sounds amazing, right? Passive income in Bitcoin just for holding.\n\nI watched STX go from $0.12 to $3.70. Sold a bit here and there, but never enough.\n\nWhy would I sell more? I was earning BTC. The number kept going up. I felt like a genius.\n\n**Going deeper**\n\nFeeling invincible, I went further:\n\n* NFTs\n* Memecoins (the usual dogs and cats)\n* DeFi farming\n* Liquidity pools\n\nThen I discovered ALEX Protocol. High yields. The ALEX token was pumping too. I thought I'd found the compound effect holy grail.\n\nSo I reinvested everything. STX, ALEX, more memecoins. All in.\n\n**The first crash**\n\nALEX got hacked.\n\nLost almost $500k overnight.\n\nBut I'm a dev, right? I built a trading app (basically a pumpfun clone on Stacks) and clawed back some losses. STX pumped to $3 again.\n\nDid I take real profits this time? Did I learn?\n\nNo.\n\n**The second crash**\n\nSTX is now $0.30. Portfolio sitting at $100k.\n\nFrom $1M peak to $100k. A 90% drawdown.\n\n**What I lost**\n\nNot just money. Years of work. The App Mining earnings. The hackathon prizes. The grants. Most of it evaporated because I couldn't bring myself to sell enough.\n\n**What I learned**\n\n1. **Don't fall into the \"passive income\" or \"HODL to earn\" trap.** Staking rewards, yield farming, earning BTC by holding—it all sounds great until you realize you're just watching your principal bleed while collecting crumbs. Just sell and take profits.\n2. **Never trust any single founder or protocol.** They can die, go to jail, get hacked, or rug. Doesn't matter how famous they are.\n3. **Diversify.** Not just across tokens—across asset classes entirely.\n4. **Buy real assets.** Property. Index funds. Things that exist outside your browser wallet.\n5. **HODL is a meme, not a strategy.** It's copium for people who can't make decisions.\n\n\n\nI'm still building in crypto. I still believe in the tech. But I no longer believe I'm smarter than the market.\n\nTake profits. Diversify. Don't be me.\n\n",

    "title": "Binance’s CZ Names the Best Bitcoin Investment Strategy",
    "selftext": "Changpeng Zhao (CZ), former Binance CEO, has once again shared his perspective on how to approach Bitcoin investing. His advice is deceptively simple,“Buy the fear, sell the greed.” This mantra reflects the cyclical nature of crypto markets, where sentiment often swings wildly between panic and euphoria. CZ stresses that disciplined strategies like dollar cost averaging (DCA) and risk management are far more effective than chasing short term hype.\n\nThe recent Crazy 48h Event provided a perfect case study of this philosophy. Traders witnessed extreme volatility across multiple phases, Liquidity surged, shorts were liquidated en masse, and Bitcoin briefly spiked before retracing. Now phase 5 is live, those who had accumulated during earlier fearful phases were rewarded, while latecomers who chased the rally found themselves caught in the reversal. It was a textbook example of CZ’s principle in action.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that Bitget hosted the event, giving traders worldwide a front row seat to the chaos. The most effective Bitcoin strategy is to stay disciplined and avoid emotional trading. Bitcoin has historically rewarded long term holders, so treating it as a strategic allocation rather than a quick trade is key.\n\nAt the same time, risk management is critical. Keep Bitcoin as a reasonable portion of your portfolio, avoid leverage, and remember that regulation and sentiment shifts can cause sharp swings. Think of Bitcoin as digital gold, so accumulate steadily, hold through cycles, and let patience, not greed, drive your returns.\n\nBitcoin’s long term trajectory is built on fundamentals, not hype. Meme coins may swing 100% in hours, but CZ’s framework reminds us that patience and discipline win over time.",

    "title": "Netflix is making a comedy movie about a couple who forgot their crypto password",
    "selftext": "The film is called One Attempt Remaining and stars Jennifer Garner. The plot is about a divorced couple who discover their cryptocurrency from a cruise they won together is now worth millions but they forgot the password. According to reports they have around a couple of days (roughly 48–72 hours) to recover $35 million before the claim expires and apparently theres basically only one attempt left to unlock it before they lose the funds for good.\n\nThis is basically every crypto holders nightmare turned into entertainment. The movie mirrors real life situations like Stefan Thomas who forgot the password to his IronKey hard drive containing 7,002 Bitcoin worth around $640 million today. He's already made 8 out of 10 allowed attempts and still hasnt gotten in. After 10 wrong tries the drive permanently erases everything.\n\nThen theres James Howells who threw away a hard drive with 8,000 Bitcoin back in 2013. Its sitting in a UK landfill somewhere and hes been fighting the city council for years to search for it but keeps losing legal battles.\n\nThe fact that Netflix is making this into a romantic comedy shows how mainstream crypto has become. These password nightmare stories used to be niche crypto community horror tales but now theyre Hollywood material.\n\nAlso, the second you *do* recover something like this, there’s a whole “ok now what” layer people forget. Cost basis, old exchange records, DeFi trails, what’s taxable vs what’s just a transfer. That part isn’t fun, but it’s real. Stuff like Awaken tax exists basically for that exact cleanup when your history is chaotic and you don’t want to guess and overpay.\n\nIts kinda funny but also dark when you think about how much wealth is permanently locked away because people forgot passwords or lost hardware. This movie will probably give everyone watching anxiety about their own crypto storage.\n\nWill definately watch this just to see how they handle the technical aspects and whether they make it accurate or go full Hollywood nonsense.",

The main reasoning for this is the fact the digital version of something is always more valuable than the analog version, so seeing bitcoins market cap match golds one day is a conservative assumption.\n\nBack in 2020 golds market cap was around $8 trillion requiring the bitcoin price to reach $380k to match golds value. This was always seen as a conservative expectation.\n\nHowever golds market cap has risen from $8 trillion in 2020 to $30 trillion today meaning bitcoin now needs to be worth $1.43 million just to meet the same conservative valuation estimates we had for gold vs bitcoin in 2020.\n\nPeople think the conservative valuation estimates we used 5 years ago still hold true, but the base case estimate for bitcoins price has gone from $380k to $1.4 million over the last few years just because golds market cap has risen in dollar terms.\n\n$1.5 million used to be seen as the highest valuation possisble, now it is the conservative base case with even higher prices likely.",

I'm not talking about your trading stack or long term btc/eth holds, specifically the stable portion thats meant to be dry powder or just earning while you wait.\n\nI’m currently sitting at about 27% stables which feels high but also rates are decent right now so not mad about it. The question is whether to keep it all liquid earning yield or deploy more into positions.\n\nmy setup right now is roughly:\n\n- 45% btc eth sol long term holds\n- 27% stables earning yield\n- 18% altcoin positions\n- 10% actual cash in bank for bills and stuff\n\nThe stable portion is split between a couple yield sources, trying not to have everything in one place. I’m getting somewhere around 7% average across them which feels good for money thats basically just waiting.\n\nBut I’m also seeing people talk about being more aggressive in current market conditions so I’m wondering if my stable allocation is too conservative or if having that cushion is actually smart. Every time I get the urge to deploy more I remember how nice it was having dry powder during the last dip.\n\nhow do you guys think about this? is there a percentage that feels right or does it depend entirely on market conditions",

So why is Elon Musk now breaking up 8,285 BTC worth roughly $770 million?\n\nThe company ranks fourth among the largest private holders of Bitcoin. Musk's influence on the crypto market is enormous. Could he be predicting a crash after January 15th, the date when MicroStrategy shares are set to be removed from the MSCI index?\n\nBitcoin split across multiple wallets is much easier to sell over-the-counter. You could just hand the buyer a seed phrase. This way, Musk and SpaceX could keep the deal quiet and avoid tanking the market.\n\nThat said, some press reports suggest the Bitcoin is being moved as part of preparations for a record-breaking IPO in 2026.",

The price even pushed past $3,350 and touched a high of $3,396 before consolidating. Right now its trading above $3,200 and showing strong momentum with a bullish trendline forming around the $3,210 support level.\n\nThe technical setup looks pretty solid. If ETH can break above the $3,380 resistance it could target $3,420 next and possibly even $3,500 to $3,550 in the near term. The momentum indicators are flipping bullish with the MACD gaining strength and RSI above 50 which usually signals more upside potential.\n\nWhats intresting is Ethereum is outperforming btc right now. While BTC struggles around $92k, ETH is showing relative strength which could mean we're seeing a rotation into alts or specifically into Ethereum based on fundamentals or technical breakouts.\n\nHowever theres still risk here. If ETH fails to clear the $3,380 level it could pull back to support at $3,250 or even $3,210. A break below $3,210 would be concerning and might send it back toward $3,150 or lower.\n\nThe consolidation after the initial pump is actually healthy. It shows buyers are absorbing supply at these levels rather than just a quick pump and dump. The question is whether buyers have enough strength to push through the next resistance zone.\n\nETH dominance has also been ticking up on the charts lately, which kind of supports the idea of a short term momentum shift away from Bitcoin, at least for now.",

    "title": "Bitcoin Looks Strong, but Interest Is Dropping.",
    "selftext": "I’ve spent the last few weeks digging into Bitcoin’s performance, the macro trends behind the big moves, and a ton of alternative data that shows how public interest is changing. Here’s what I found.\n\n**1. Bitcoin’s last two years were wild.**  \nWe went from the post-FTX depression to new highs above $126k, then back down into the mid-$80k range. Even with the big pullback, the long term move is still incredibly strong.\n\n**2. The rally was mostly driven by three (maybe four) things:** \n\n* Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States finally going live\n* The 2024 halving and the predictable scarcity narrative\n* Expectations for lower interest rates and a friendlier macro backdrop\n* The new US administration is, in lack of a better word, more crypto-friendly than the former administration\n\n**3. The hedge debate is more complicated than people make it.**  \nAfter digging into studies and price behavior, my takeaway is this:  \nBitcoin can hedge long term debasement because of its fixed supply, but it does not behave like a short term hedge against the dollar. Money supply has been rising lately, but bitcoin hasn't followed. When markets de-risk, Bitcoin usually sells off in the same direction as tech stocks. Bitcoin might still protect you from a long term weak dollar, but not from short term risk-off / volatility.\n\n**4. The alternative data surprised me. Interest is cooling.**  \nThis is the part I didn’t expect to be so obvious:\n\n* Google searches for “Bitcoin” are down nearly 50 percent YoY\n* r/Bitcoin subreddit growth has slowed to just 1 percent in the last 3 months\n* Bitcoin’s Wikipedia views dropped from \\~10k per day to \\~4k\n* Sentiment across crypto forums is turning bearish\n\nIt feels like excitement has cooled even though the price is still up massively over two years. \n\n**5. What I’m watching next:**  \n• ETF inflows or outflows  \n• The Fed’s approach to rates  \n• Whether search interest and community momentum pick back up  \n• Any regulatory shifts, especially since the Trump administration has historically been more pro-crypto\n\n**My personal take:**  \nBitcoin still makes sense as a long term asset with a fixed supply and global adoption. But in the short run it behaves like a high beta macro trade, not a clean hedge. The data shows retail attention is fading, which might mean we are in the middle of a cooling phase rather than a new explosive rally.\n\nCurious to hear what others think. Does this align with your view, or are you seeing something different?",

    "selftext": "Speaking in Abu Dhabi, Saylor laid out a vision where countries could use Bitcoin reserves and tokenized credit to offer regulated bank accounts that give way higher returns than traditional deposits. He pointed out that banks in Japan, Europe and Switzerland barely pay any interest while US money market funds are around 4%. People are basically disgusted with their bank accounts which is why corporate bonds exist.\n\nHis proposal involves structuring accounts with about 80% digital credit instruments, 20% regular currency, and an extra 10% buffer to reduce volatility. The digital credit layer would be backed by Bitcoin reserves with about 5 to 1 overcollateralization. Basically using Bitcoin as the ultimate collateral layer.\n\nSaylor thinks a country that implements this could attract $20 to $50 trillion in deposits and become the digital banking capital of the world. Thats not a small claim.\n\nHowever theres obvious skepticism here. Bitcoin is down 28% from its recent highs and dropped 9% over the past year. The volatility makes people question how you can build stable high yield products on top of it. One former bond trader called Saylors moves folly and said hiking rates to maintain a peg wont work when people want their money back during a panic.\n\nStrategy already has a product called STRC that works somewhat like this - its grown to $2.9 billion but faces doubts about whether it can handle a real liquidity crunch.\n\nThe idea is innovative but feels like it requires Bitcoin to keep appreciating long term to actually work.

    "selftext": "Bitcoin’s energy use has been one of its biggest criticisms for years, but Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang just offered a very different perspective. Speaking during a panel on AI and energy, Huang said Bitcoin actually converts excess electricity into a portable form of money essentially reframing mining as a way to monetize unused power rather than waste it. Coming from the guy whose chips run most of today’s AI infrastructure, it’s a notable shift in tone. Supporters of Bitcoin have been arguing for a while that more mining is happening on stranded or renewable energy, and Huang’s comments line up with that narrative. It doesn’t magically solve all the environmental concerns, but it’s interesting to hear a major tech leader describe Bitcoin as part of the energy economy instead of a problem for it. Curious how others here see this is this a fair way to look at mining, or just a convenient reframing?",

    "title": "BTC as collateral? Brilliant!",
    "selftext": "Back in October 2024 when BTC was in the 63–70k range, I needed liquidity but didn’t really want to sell. Instead I took a crypto-backed loan through one of the larger CeFi lenders (think nехо) where I already kept part of my BTC. I later found out they’re actually one of the biggest players in the space, right after Tether in terms of lending volume, which made me realise how mainstream this model has become.\n\nI used BTC as collateral, got the funds I needed, and just left the coins sitting there. Fast forward to BTC above 110k - loan was repaid and I’m pretty relieved I didn’t try to time the market. For me this was never about leverage. It was simply about not being forced to sell an asset I still believe in long-term.\n\nThere’s also a psychological benefit. When your BTC isn’t sitting in your spot wallet as a big shiny “sell” button, you’re less tempted to panic on every dip. You get liquidity without second-guessing yourself during volatility.\n\nAnyone else using loans instead of selling?",

    "title": "Coinbase is predicting Bitcoin could see a December recovery based on macro conditions but theres some important caveats.",
    "selftext": "Their research team is pointing to improving liquidity and markets pricing in about a 92% chance of a Fed rate cut at the December 9–10 meeting. As of December 4th the odds of a rate cut jumped to 92%, which has often been supportive for risk assets like crypto in past cycles. They're also tracking global money supply which has been expanding lately.\n\nBack in October Coinbase actually predicted weakness in November followed by a December reversal and so far that's playing out. Bitcoin is hovering around $90k after dropping from highs near $100k last month.\n\nHowever the big wildcard is Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments during the rate decision press conference. Analysts say if Powell sounds hawkish about 2026 policy it could put a cap on any rally even if they cut rates. His previous hawkish remarks in November contributed to the selloff we just saw.\n\nMarket sentiment is still pretty fearful right now. Both institutional and retail investors are hesitant to jump back in which is keeping markets in limbo. The technical picture shows Bitcoin already retested the $80k area and bounced off support tho.\n\nOne positive catalyst is speculation that Kevin Hassett might become the next Fed Chair in 2026. He's seen as way more dovish which would be bullish for crypto long term.\n\nSo basically the setup looks decent for a December recovery but everyones gonna be watching what Powell says super closely. One wrong comment could derail things fast.",

    "selftext": "JPMorgan analysts claim that, in the near future, the price of Bitcoin will be more dependent on the financial strategy of MicroStrategy (MSTR) than on the actions of miners. The key indicator is the ratio of the company's value to the volume of its Bitcoin reserves. \n\nAs long as this ratio remains above one — the current value is 1.13 — the risk of the largest corporate holder being forced to sell cryptocurrency to cover its debts remains minimal. The company's fiat reserve of $1.44 billion provides an additional safety cushion.\n\nMiners are certainly under pressure: the estimated cost of mining is $90,000, forcing high-cost players to sell coins at current prices. However, experts consider this factor to be less important than the stability of MSTR's share price. \n\nInterestingly, the success of MicroStrategy's Bitcoin accumulation strategy hinges on JPMorgan. If the bank excludes MSTR shares from the MSCI index in January, the shares will continue to depreciate and the Bitcoin price will plummet too.\n\nNevertheless, JPMorgan analysts remain optimistic, expecting the first cryptocurrency to reach $170,000 within six to twelve months. Could this be considered insider information, providing an excellent opportunity to buy MSTR and BTC while they are low?",

Ryan McMillin, CIO at Merkle Tree Capital, points to a mix of monetary debasement fears, macro uncertainty, and inconsistent central bank signals as key drivers behind the metals' strength. \n\nMcMillin notes that investors are preparing for a possible policy error where the Fed may begin cutting rates while inflation remains above the 2% target.\n\nWith capital rotating toward U.S. equities, I’ve been exploring stock futures more closely.

    "title": "An unpopular truth: there are no actual \"cycles\"",
    "selftext": "Please read before challenge the headline .\n\n.\nThe notion of predictable \"cycles\" in Bitcoin's price is a persistent misconception. Unlike commodities or equities—where supply and demand respond to external factors like geopolitics, weather, or industrial output—Bitcoin follows a different economic logic.\n.\n\nBitcoin is not a manufactured good nor a traditional commodity. Its supply is algorithmically fixed: only 21 million will ever exist, and its issuance rate (mining reward) adjusts solely through predetermined halvings, which reduce new supply at regular intervals. This makes Bitcoin's supply perfectly inelastic—unaffected by miner count, network activity, or global economic conditions.\n.\n\nWhat truly drives Bitcoin's price is adoption, currently fueled largely by its role as a speculative asset rather than a medium of exchange. Its value is shaped primarily by four factors: the halving mechanism, adoption curves, fiat money supply expansion, and regulatory developments. Other macroeconomic variables—such as oil prices or real estate markets—affect Bitcoin only indirectly, in much the same way they influence fiat currencies like the dollar or yen. The key difference is Bitcoin’s absolute scarcity, which may one day position it as a benchmark for global value.\n.\n\nLarge holders (\"whales\") understand this deeply. Their objective is not to control Bitcoin's protocol—which remains decentralized—but to accumulate enough of its limited supply to exert influence over future economic leverage. Retail investors, meanwhile, often behave like a school of fish: moving on collective instinct rather than independent analysis. Much like humpback whales using bubble nets to herd prey, major players can orchestrate market narratives through timed campaigns, influencer messaging, and capitalizing on periods of market vulnerability—such as holidays or low-liquidity events—to artificially depress prices. The billions they deploy to buy during these engineered dips represent the whale's open mouth; the losses absorbed by unprepared traders are the inevitable result.\n.\n\nWhen you filter out the market noise created by these tactics, Bitcoin’s underlying trajectory becomes clearer. This is why maximalists advocate a simple strategy: ignore short-term signals, avoid timing the market, and consistently accumulate during dips. Regardless of whether the price is $1 or $20 million per bitcoin, disciplined accumulation remains the most reliable way to participate in its long-term appreciation—without falling prey to the whales' games.\n\nYour inputs are appreciated 👍",

    "selftext": "Between November 24 and December 2nd we saw three massive moves. JPMorgan filed to launch leveraged products tied to BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF. Nasdaq proposed to quadruple the limits on Bitcoin ETF options from 250,000 to 1 million contracts. Then Vanguard, who always said no to crypto, suddenly reversed course and opened Bitcoin and other crypto ETFs to their \\~50 million clients on a platform that oversees around $11 trillion.\n\nThis is wild because Vanguard's leadership was publicly against Bitcoin ETFs just last year. Now they’re effectively offering access to spot Bitcoin exposure to tens of millions of investors. Bank of America is letting 15,000 financial advisors recommend Bitcoin starting January 2026 with allocations between 1 to 4 percent of portfolios.\n\nWhat makes this interesting is the timing. This all happened while retail investors were panic selling and getting rekt. Institutions basically waited for retail to capitulate then swooped in with their infrastructure fully built out. Sovereign wealth funds like Abu Dhabi Investment Council increased their Bitcoin positions as regular people were exiting.\n\nBut here’s the catch – while institutions are embracing Bitcoin through ETFs and derivatives, index providers like MSCI are simultaneously trying to exclude companies like Strategy that buy Bitcoin directly for their treasuries. MSCI proposed removing these companies from major indices, which would force them out of a lot of passive funds.\n\nso bitcoin is getting institutionalized but mainly through fee generating products that banks and asset managers control. the original model of companies holding bitcoin directly on balance sheets is facing obstacles, while ETF models that generate recurring revenue for financial firms are getting pushed hard.\n\nif you’re actually trying to see how that shows up in your own taxes and portfolio (ETFs vs holding btc / eth outright) messing around with something like awaken tax is way more useful than doomscrolling headlines ngl it at least forces you to see how your “btc exposure” is split between fee products and actual coins.\n\nBitcoin was supposed to work around the traditional system but now it’s basically being absorbed into it.\n\nThoughts on this shift?",

Meanwhile, Solana gets a boost with Kalshi's tokenized event contracts landing on the chain. $SOL holders, rejoice! What's your top pick this month?\n\nSo Bitcoin has been on a bit of a rollercoaster again. After tanking recently, it actually bounced back to around $93k today, which a lot of people are crediting to some surprisingly positive regulatory and macro news.\n\nEver since BTC hit $126k on Oct 6th, it has basically been drifting downwards with no clear direction. So personally, I am playing it safe. I have been sticking to on-chain tokens on Bitget because the rewards are consistent and it doesn’t stress over every BTC swing. It has been a good balance for me also the new comers, safer but still generating returns.\n\nAdd in rising expectations of a Fed rate cut next week, and it makes sense why BTC suddenly has some upward pressure again. But volatility lately has been wild, and I am not convinced this rebound is going to be smooth or stable.\n\n\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana\n\n",

    "selftext": "About 2-3 weeks ago I said we would be back above 90k people thought I was crazy. Too many people will see a pullback and think bear market when if they were to just zoom out they would see btc is still in a bullish trend in the weekly and monthly timeframe. we had a nice bullish engulfing candle now its still to soon to celebrate, but I still think btc will reach 115-120k then from there it will either make new highs or reverse back towards the 80s based on the technical analysis I've been looking at. Currently we want to see btc reach 98-102k but before that we \"could\" see a pullback to 88-90k to liquidate some longs.\n\nIf btc does continue and just pushes to 98k-102k\n\nif the weekly btc candle closes under 88k then I would expect some bearish movement to create new lows again to dip under 80k create some more fear but based on how it does it might show more continuation to the downside or a reversal to the upside after liquidating the longs from 80k \n\nI would still expect a pullback to liquidate late longers but as we know the market sometimes will let liquidity build up let people feel super  safe then punish.\n\nTrade carefully, be mindful of leverage trading wait for pullbacks if you didn't start your trades before the recent bullish moves. \n\nUse proper risk management 👌🏾 ",

    "title": "Retail Is Dead, Institutions Will Rise: Understanding the Next Global Crypto Bull Market",
    "selftext": "**Conclusion first:** The next three years will be an institution-driven bull market. This marks the moment when **crypto and blockchain officially enter the balance sheets of Wall Street**, bringing about true mass adoption—not through a bottom-up de-central-bank revolution, but a **top-down financial infrastructure upgrade**.\n\nRetail traders are like the tide; institutions are the sea.  \nThe tide retreats. The sea does not.\n\n# Reviewing 2025: The \"First Year of Institutions\n\n* **Inflow Source:** Almost all major capital flowing into **BTC/ETH** in 2025 came from institutions (67% of allocation), not retail. Retail traders focused on meme/altcoins.\n* **Key Drivers:** The explosion of **ETFs** (holding 5.7%–7.4% of circulating BTC supply) monopolized Bitcoin's primary inflow routes.\n* **Market Formation:** Low tradable supply (due to ETF custody) combined with continuous institutional buying created a **liquidity-shock bull market**.\n* **Institutional Catalyst:** **U.S. regulatory clarity** (stablecoin laws, ETF approvals) enabled legal, compliant, and scaled institutional entry to meet massive demand (estimated 80:1 demand-supply ratio for BTC).\n\n# The Trillion-Dollar Impact\n\n* **Financial Scale:** Institutions control 70–80% of the $600T+ global investable assets. A mere **1% portfolio reallocation** from this pool could **double BTC's market cap** (trillions of dollars).\n* **Core Narrative:** This shift makes **Real World Assets (RWA)** the core narrative of the next cycle.\n\n# Long-Term Roles of Major Assets\n\n* **BTC:** Becomes the **Digital Gold** and an institutional reserve asset, driving slow, trend-driven price movements.\n* **ETH:** Becomes the **\"Equity Asset\"** of the global on-chain economy, valued based on network scale and usage, offering staking yield (dividends).\n\n# Opportunity &amp; Strategy Shift\n\n* **Retail's New Role:** Retail transitions from **narrative makers to price followers**. Strategies must shift from emotion/short-term speculation to **following major structural flows** and cross-cycle investing.\n* **Key Growth Sectors (VCs &amp; Founders):**\n   1. **Enterprise/Institutional Blockchains:** Private, compliant chains (like Hyperledger) for bank settlement and pensions.\n   2. **Bridging + ZK:** Essential for connecting private enterprise chains with public chains (RWA ↔️ public crypto).\n   3. **Custody &amp; Asset-Management Tools:** Platforms like Fireblocks and Copper.\n   4. **RWA &amp; Settlement Layers:** Tokenizing Treasuries, private credit, and creating on-chain SWIFT equivalents.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The next bull market is an **upgrade to the global financial system**, not a revolution. Retail influence on major-coin prices will hit all-time lows. Success for retail means **understanding capital logic** and positioning for structural, enterprise-driven infrastructure trends.",

    "selftext": "I was up late last night double-checking the latest filings because the “they’ll have to sell BTC every quarter for the $750 M dividend” narrative was still driving me nuts. Turns out Saylor already solved it months ago and barely anyone noticed: Strategy has a dedicated $1.44 billion USD dividend reserve in plain old cash and cash equivalents. That’s almost two full years roughly 23 months of the entire preferred dividend obligation covered in fiat, zero Bitcoin required.  \n\nIt’s actually kind of hilarious how over-prepared they were; they raised extra on purpose, parked it in dollars, and just let the loudest bear case of the year die of natural causes. No wonder the stock barely flinches on red days anymore and the gamma feels unbreakable this cycle. The forced-seller risk that haunted 2021–2024 is legitimately gone until late 2027 at the earliest.\n\nPersonal aside while I’m here same late night session I also opened one of those Bitget onchain Mystery Boxes I keep a small futures position open there for hedging. Literally $500–600 in volume this month and I still got 22 USDT plus a random token drop. If you already trade on Bitget it’s the easiest free roll I’ve seen in a while and even tiny retail volume qualifies. Feels like the whole market is shifting toward real holders getting the small edges this time around.",

    "title": "Crypto Cycle Rationale",
    "selftext": "I would find interesting to read well argumented  opinions on “crypto cycle” as this whole thing is or always was IMO kind of “artificial”. \n\nIn general I am crypto friendly person, and have  some investments, but I also want to be strictly rational investor and not a narrative-driven.\n\nIn past, there obviously were those cycles whose fundamental part (or cause?) was bitcoin halving event and its consequences. Also while there are no technical dependencies between Bitcoin and all those alt coins, there is actually super-strong dependency and everyone can see how precisely all altcoins copy bitcoin (with exception here or there). This is a clear evidence of still speculative component in price, and very little value. If trust in bitcoin shakes, whole industry shakes - a dominantly trust based “asset class” as the real use and value still needs to be developed. \n\nBut what about that cycle, which seems to be broken now? \n\nIMO the cycle was kind of convention created by bitcoin community - and it was passed on newcomers. Since it is all mostly based on trust, this convention was kind of guide in terms of where we are - is it good to buy, enter or sell? It worked somehow. Also part of this cycle were those waves or sequence:\n\n1. Cash BTC\n2. Pump and dump ether\n3. Pump and dump altcoin1-n \n\nAll was like a scripted game which helped to navigate.\n\nBut this “seasonality” does not exist on WallStreet and in Fin industry at all. The speculation there is omnipresent but most assets have underlying value - commodities are best example and events affecting underlying value is what drives price movements adjusted by speculation and trading approaches. \n\nSo once these big institutional players went into bitcoin, many applauded as price went up. However “kids game/convention” was effectively broken as these guys do not follow some convention, cycle etc. They came with their very own rules!  \n\nIMO they did not join this game just to pump and dump massively this asset and “destroy” further adoption potential. \nTheir strategy is more long term and less about that massive volatility. They dont like huge crashes. IMO it is these guys who protected price from “cyclic crash” which they did not join, they bought the dips triggered by retailers etc. \n\nSo the game changed. That is my opinion, but I keep hearing those who still think all is the same and they rule the game - they believe in classic cycle, which is not reality any more IMO. \n\nSo folks, is my reasoning flawed or how do you see that?

    "title": "Crypto Starts December in the Red as Bitcoin, Ethereum Extend Sell Off",
    "selftext": "Crypto markets opened the new month with more weakness, as Bitcoin and Ethereum both moved sharply lower on Monday. Bitcoin dropped over 5% and was trading around $86,435, while Ethereum slid more than 6% to roughly $2,843. The weakness wasn’t limited to the top two coins. Solana fell more than 7%, and broader altcoins followed the same trend Dogecoin slipped nearly 9%. The pressure extended to Asia as well, after the People’s Bank of China issued a warning about illegal digital currency activity, pulling down several Hong Kong–listed crypto-linked stocks. Market sentiment remains risk-off, and analysts say a large chunk of the move appears tied to liquidations. Ben Emons of Fedwatch Advisors told CNBC that a roughly $400 million exchange liquidation was a major driver of Monday’s downturn. He also pointed to the extremely high leverage still present on crypto exchanges, with some platforms offering up to 200x leverage. According to Emons, the amount of perpetual futures leverage outstanding estimated around $787 billion dwarfs ETF-linked exposure, and leaves the market vulnerable to more forced selling if prices remain weak. Bitcoin’s behavior continues to show stronger correlation with tech indexes, especially the Nasdaq, something that became obvious during October’s market slide. Emons also highlighted that the current environment is heavily driven by retail traders, which typically adds more volatility and faster reactions during sell-offs. Broader macro uncertainty isn’t helping either. Questions around U.S. interest rate cuts, combined with concerns about stretched valuations in the AI sector, added to November’s choppy action and crypto volatility has followed the same pattern. For now, analysts describe the setup as fragile, with sentiment still cautious and leverage remaining a key risk factor if prices fall further.",

    "title": "Are bitcoin whales actually hesitating right now or just playing it smart? the data looks weird",
    "selftext": "Recent analysis from Joao Wedson is showing something a bit uncomfortable – wallets holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC have pretty much stopped adding. That band usually lines up with funds, desks and more “professional” money. Historically when these guys stop pressing the buy button for a while it hasn’t been a great vibe for price later.\n\nThe spooky part is it looks a lot like 2021. Back then the same wallet range cooled off on accumulation and a few months later we slid into a proper bear market. Not saying copy paste crash incoming but it’s one of those signals you don’t just ignore.\n\nBut there’s a twist here. After that December nuke where institutions dumped around 79,000 BTC and we got hit with roughly a 15% correction, some of the bigger players actually started buying back in. Over the last 30 days or so they’ve scooped up something like 34,000 BTC again which means at least some whales think these levels are decent entry or reload zones.\n\nSo on one side you’ve got those mid sized 100–1,000 BTC wallets acting cautious and on the other side you’ve got larger institutional guys quietly stacking the dip. The pause from the mid tier whales feels like weaker medium term demand but the bigger wallets stepping in should add some kind of floor underneath.\n\nThe annoying part is retail is still basically asleep. Most of this is just big wallets and structured money slapping each other around so price action feels less like a classic cycle and more like a liquidity game.\n\nAre whales positioning for something big or just managing risk after a crazy run up hard to say for sure but these mixed signals are definitely worth keeping an eye on",

Let me make it clear, I’m not talking about shitcoins I’m talking about bitcoin/ Ethereum i do not believe in some random ”Trump” coin tbh. Nobody that bought at the top in 2021 are minus today. They were almost plus 100%. And if you’re talking about dips. Bitcoin just dipped 30% from the top like come on…\n\n\nEdit again: i tried to tell you to dca i really tried.. you had the chance of another 10% but you would only tell me ”I will time bitcoin” 😩",

    "title": "Fat-Fingered Robinhood Bitcoin Limit Order",
    "selftext": "So I was buying some Bitcoin yesterday on the dip and entering $250 limit orders under the current market price.  BTC was trading for about $90,150 @ at the ask and it was my intention to place a limit order with a Target price of 90,100, or $50 below the current ask. I mistakenly fat fingered the order for 91,000 rather than $90,100.  \n\nNow I have traded with Schwab for many years and if you ever enter a limit order above the current ask you get a warning that your order May immediately execute as it is above the current ask. No warning for me on Robinhood and you guessed it, the order filled at 91,000, which was $850 over the current ask at the time. Not used to being completely ripped off I was flabbergasted. I contacted support and finally got through to an agent who gave me three paragraphs of gobbledygook about it being totally my fault and that I was properly filled at the best available price at the time which just happened to be my limit price which was $850 over the current ask. I asked them exactly who scooped my order and pocketed the hefty premium and the agent broke off the chat.  \n\nYes, I made a mistake. No I did not expect to be completely taken advantage of and ripped off by an opportunistic broker. Is this not outright thievery or am I overreacting? I now trust Robin Hood about as far as I can throw Vlad. I will definitely be taking all my crypto business elsewhere. Please be forewarned when entering limit orders. Robin Hood does not have your back.\n\nWhat are your suggestions for a new crypto broker? I already have a Strike account for Bitcoin but am interested in any other recommendations. Thank you.",

    "title": "How Bitcoin turned its “strongest month” into its worst in 7 years...",
    "selftext": "Bitcoin is having one of its worst Novembers since the 2018 bear market and here’s why it’s happening.\n\nSo far this month, Bitcoin is down roughly 17–20%, trading around the $90–92k range. That’s pretty close to the losses from November 2019, when BTC dropped about 17–18%. The worst November on record was back in 2018, with a brutal ~36% crash in the middle of that bear market.\n\nHistorically, November has actually been one of Bitcoin’s strongest months, with average returns around 40% in past cycles, so this kind of red November is a big break from the usual pattern. One major structural change this time around is that U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs finally launched in January 2024, which pulled a lot of institutional money directly into BTC and may have shifted the timing of the typical post-halving “euphoria” phase.\n\nSince those ETFs went live, institutions and large funds have played a much bigger role in price action, and a lot of analysts think that’s changed the rhythm of this cycle. Instead of the classic script where October and November often rip higher, this year October already closed slightly red and November is now deeply negative despite that historically bullish seasonality.\n\nAnother huge factor has been leverage getting nuked. A ton of traders were running oversized long positions with borrowed money, and when the October and November sell-offs hit, billions of dollars in longs were force-liquidated. That cascade of liquidations amplified the downside and helped drive BTC from an all-time high around $126k in October down into the low $80ks at the worst point of this drawdown.\n\nSome analysts actually see this “flush” as a necessary cleansing process. It shakes out over-leveraged players and weak hands, kills off some of the froth, and can set up a healthier base for the next leg up once the market digests all the forced selling.\n\nOne interesting pattern from the last decade: every time Bitcoin has had a red November, December has also finished red. That doesn’t guarantee anything, but if that pattern holds and you combine it with the usual post-halving correction, it wouldn’t be shocking if real recovery takes time and stretches well into 2026 rather than bouncing straight back in the next few weeks",

    "selftext": "A trader that on chain analyst The Data Nerd spotted just opened a massive BTC long on Hyperliquid.... about $84.19 million with 3x leverage. That’s not pocket change, that’s serious conviction that Bitcoin is heading up.\n\nWhat makes this interesting is the timing. Bitcoin is sitting around the low $90k range right now and has been pretty volatile lately. This trader is basically betting big that we’re going to see higher prices soon. The position uses leverage too, which means the gains could be huge but so could the losses if things go south.\n\nThe market has definitely been heating up. Daily BTC trading volume is in the high tens of billions of dollars right now, so there’s clearly a lot of activity and interest. Between whales, derivatives and bigger players still taking directional bets, there’s plenty of fuel for more volatility in both directions.\n\nThese kinds of whale moves usually create ripple effects. Other traders see this and it ends up influencing their decisions – sometimes it brings in more buyers, sometimes it just adds even more chaos to the price action.\n\nPersonally I think it’s wild to see someone throw that much money on a leveraged bet. One wrong move and that’s a massive liquidation. But clearly some people are still comfortable taking huge swings at these levels.\n\nAnyone else watching this play out What do you think happens next with Bitcoin",

    "title": "Is This 'Relief Rally' Just a Trap? When Will the Real Trend Be Revealed?",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone! We've recently seen a temporary spike in Bitcoin's price, which has raised hopes for many. However, I still believe this might just be a **\"Relief Rally\"** or a **Bear Market Rally**, and we could still be firmly within a larger downtrend.\n\n\n\n# The Big Question: Has the Market Truly Bottomed Out?\n\nThere's a crucial conflict here:\n\n1. **The Rally's Reality:** This temporary increase could be the result of short-covering and short-term trading activity. If key support levels fail (80K), the primary downtrend could resume.\n2. **The Role of Extreme Sentiment:** We know that when market sentiment becomes extremely negative and everyone gives up hope, that's often when a major **Bullish Reversal** occurs, and the market starts its journey toward a new All-Time High (ATH). This situation is commonly referred to as **\"Blood in the streets.\"**\n\n# The Current State: Neither Bull Nor Bear?\n\nRight now, I don't see the kind of extreme negative sentiment that would confirm we've hit the final bottom. There is some Fear, but not the widespread Panic or Despair needed for a massive reversal.\n\n* **The Market's Next Move:** After this rally, the price will likely enter a **Sideways Consolidation** phase.\n* **The Deciding Factor:** This consolidation period will be the key to determining whether we get **Bull Continuation** or **Bear Trend Continuation**. We will only be able to confirm whether we're heading toward new highs or sinking further down after observing the market's movement for a few more days/weeks.\n\n  \n**Are you currently seeing \"Extreme Despair\" in the market?** Or is more panic yet to come? What strategy are you adopting for this potential sideways period? (e.g., DCA, Sell the Rally, or Wait and See?)\n\n\\#Bitcoin #CryptoTA #BearMarketRally #Sentiment #BottomingOut #HODL",

Its been a surprisingly low  stress way to stay engaged with the market, and it makes me wonder if events like this could become a standard tool for traders, letting people experiment, learn, and manage risk without committing huge amounts of capital.\n\nCurious to hear how others are navigating this volatility, using automated tools, trading manually, or just sitting tight for now?\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)",

It’s pretty clear now that crypto doesn’t move independently anymore when stocks fall, crypto falls too.\n\nWhat this made me realize is how useful it is to trade crypto and tokenized stocks in the same place. When both markets are slipping, there’s no time to jump between different platforms just to protect your positions. Having everything in one setup makes it way easier to adjust quickly.\n\nAnd honestly, I’m not surprised exchanges are starting to lean into this idea with more cross-market features and onchain events like the Bitget Onchain challenge. It matches what traders are dealing with every day: stocks and crypto reacting to the same pressures at the same time.

Serenity is now in the top tier of compliant digital-asset platforms.\n\n**✅ Institutional green light**  \nMiCA compliance dramatically increases the eligibility of SERSH for **funds, family offices, regulated exchanges and custody providers**.  \nMiCA-aligned tokens can command higher trust, stronger valuations and broader integration into **RWA and DeFi collateral frameworks**.\n\n**✅ Tier 1 partnerships now unlocked**  \nBanks, enterprises, and government-level entities require MiCA-ready partners. Serenity is now positioned for high-value integrations impossible for non-compliant projects.\n\n**✅ Investor magnet**  \nPrivate equity, VC, and institutional capital finally have the regulatory clarity needed to scale into the Serenity ecosystem with confidence.\n\n**Why this puts Serenity in a league of its own**\n\nSerenity SERSH is not just a token, it is an entire **regulatory-ready Web3 infrastructure stack** powered by:  \n• the biometric hardware wallet **sAxess**, now supporting **BTC ,TRX, XRP blockchain**  \n**•** With the upcoming Bridge **SERSH** will be also avalible on **ETH , BASE , and SOL** blockchain  \n• the patented privacy-preserving **DeDaSP protocol**,  \n• a full **RWA/RWS tokenization engine** engineered for compliance-first deployment.\n\nMiCA registration proves execution, maturity, and long-term resilience, shifting the narrative from hype to **verified regulatory strength and institutional-grade credibility**.\n\nAs the EU prepares for full MiCA enforcement by 2026, Serenity stands **years ahead of competitors**, perfectly positioned for mass adoption across finance, enterprise and public-sector ecosystems.\n\nThis is not just a milestone,  \n**this is Serenity entering its institutional era.**\n\nread the full article on CMC : [https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/691c9928b8d7b80a2e3f5155/](https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/691c9928b8d7b80a2e3f5155/)\n\nJoin Serenity : [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/serenity-shield/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/serenity-shield/)",

    "selftext": "***From Business Insider's Jennifer Sor:***\n\nIt's been a tough month for bitcoin investors.\n\nThe OG cryptocurrency officially entered a bear market at the beginning of this month, with the token's price down 22% since reaching a peak of around $126,000 in early October.\n\nAfter being up as much as 35% year-to-date, the latest tumble has whittled that gain down to less than 4% on Friday.\n\nThe sell-off accelerated this week. Bitcoin dropped as low as $94,700 on Friday, the lowest the crypto has traded in about six months.\n\nWaning liquidity, this week's tech sell-off, and rumored selling from Strategy were adding pressure.\n\nBitcoin has been hurt amid a broader sell-off in risk assets, with tech stocks in particular getting hit hard as investors fret over high valuations.\n\nOutflows from spot bitcoin ETFs hit $866.7 million on Thursday, according to data from CoinGlass, the worst outflow bitcoin funds have seen since early August.\n\n\"In some ways, Bitcoin was a leading indicator for risk,\" David Nicholas, the CEO of XFUNDS, wrote in a note this week, pointing to recent concerns among investors about valuations in the stock market. \"I think it's the perfect recipe for Bitcoin price weakness,\" he added.\n\nBitcoin's liquidity has also dropped off over the last month, a possible reason the crypto's price has seen more volatility.\n\nBitcoin's market depth, a measure of how resistant its price is to volatility stemming from large trades, dropped from around $766 million in early October $535.2 million as of this week, according to the crypto analytics firm Kaiko.\n\nThe sell-off picked up steam on Friday as Michael Saylor, the founder of Strategy and one of bitcoin's biggest cheerleaders over the years, fended off online rumors that his crypto treasury dumped some of its bitcoin holdings.\n\n\"I think the volatility comes with the territory,\" Saylor said of the latest sell-off.\n\n[Read the full story on why Bitcoin might wipe out its gains for the year here.](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-bitcoin-is-falling-btc-price-selloff-saylor-strategy-tech-2025-11?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=insider-bitcoinmarkets-sub-comment)",

    "title": "My Take on $ALLO Price Drop",
    "selftext": "The whole $ALLO situation has been messy since listing. Most people aren’t happy with how it turned out, and honestly, I get why. The price fell more than 60% in just one day, way below what most expected after it got listed on Binance, Coinbase, OKX, KuCoin, and Bitget.\n\n  \nTo me, this kind of move isn’t shocking. It’s the same story that happens after almost every major listing. The hype builds, people rush in, and then airdrop holders and early investors start dumping to lock profits. Binance alone dropped 15 million tokens to BNB holders, and most of them didn’t even wait; they just sold on sight. The result was huge trading volume and even bigger sell pressure.\n\n  \nThe other thing that’s making investors uneasy is the valuation. $ALLO’s fully diluted value is sitting around $600M, while its market cap is only about $115M. That’s a big gap. Only 20% of its supply is in circulation, meaning there’s still about 80% of tokens waiting to enter the market later. That future unlock alone is enough to scare new buyers.\n\n  \nWhen you compare it to other decentralized AI projects like $FET or $RNDR, $ALLO still looks expensive for what it currently delivers. So it’s not just about the market being red, it’s about people questioning if the token is really worth that kind of FDV right now.\n\n  \nThe overall market mood isn’t helping either. Fear sentiment has been high, and most traders are running back to $BTC and $ETH, leaving small caps to bleed. But even with that, $ALLO’s 66% crash is still way beyond normal. It feels like the AI narrative couldn’t hold up against all the selling pressure.\n\n  \nStill, I don’t see it as all bad. A lot of people are panicking, but this might actually open up a window to get in lower. I’ve been watching Bitget’s CandyBomb section, and seeing $ALLO featured there makes me think there’s still some opportunity to play around it, maybe not immediately, but when the noise settles a bit.\n\n  \n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/allora](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/allora)",

When someone joins, a small amount of coins get made. Most go to the new user, some go to whoever invited them, and a small cut goes up the chain to the original creator wallet. Nobody pays anything to join.\n\nThe total supply would be capped at 9.63 million coins. As more people join, the reward gets smaller, kind of like Bitcoin halving. The goal is to make it fair, scarce, and fast enough to use for everyday payments. I know “referral based” ideas can sound shady, but this one doesn’t take anyone’s money. It’s just an experiment in creating value through verified human networks instead of hardware or capital.\n\nCurious what people think. What would make this work or fail in practice?",

    "selftext": "I’ve been watching $ARIAIP for a while now, just trying to understand what kind of token it really is. It’s not one of those hype driven coins that move only on sentiment, but it’s also not yet something I’d call fully established. It sits somewhere in between, still figuring out its place in the market.  \n  \nMost of its supply is still locked, and that part always matters to me. Once those tokens start unlocking, there’s usually some movement. Prices tend to react when more supply hits the market, especially if the demand hasn’t really picked up yet. It’s just the normal rhythm I’ve seen play out before.  \n  \nThe whole idea around tokenizing music rights sounds fine, but I’m not treating it as something that changes the game overnight. It takes time, legal work, and a lot of structure to make that kind of model work. I’m just observing for now, watching how it grows and how they handle things like regulation and adoption.  \n  \nFor now I’m just keeping my BTC locked on Bitget PoolX to see how things unfold. If the project starts showing consistent progress I might consider building a position later. No rush, I’d rather see how it performs before deciding what kind of exposure it’s really worth.  \n  \n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aria-protocol](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aria-protocol)",

    "title": "BitcoinOS (BOS) just got listed",
    "selftext": "I just noticed that BitcoinOS ($BOS) has officially gone live on BingX, and honestly, this one caught my attention. The project is aiming to become an operating system for Bitcoin, building smart contracts, rollups, and programmable assets directly anchored to Bitcoin’s security model.\n\nWhat makes it interesting is how it’s trying to make Bitcoin more than just a store of value. BOS wants to enable things like bridgeless BTC transfers across networks, DeFi apps, and even interoperability with other blockchains. Basically, giving Bitcoin the kind of utility Ethereum and Solana have been known for.\n\nThe BingX listing could be a big step for visibility and liquidity, especially since the exchange has been adding trending projects lately. BOS having a long-term emission plan (21 billion supply) also suggests they’re thinking beyond short hype cycles.\n\nOf course, it’s still early, so there’s execution risk and a lot to prove in terms of adoption. But the idea of expanding Bitcoin’s capabilities without compromising its core decentralization is pretty bold.\n\n https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoinos/",

    "selftext": "The latest news cycle surrounding MSTR (MicroStrategy) has created an ideal, high-volatility environment for disciplined futures trading, offering opportunities in both directions .\n\nOn one side, the news is aggressively bullish: the acquisition of another 390 BTC solidifies MSTR's treasury at over 640,808 BTC, cementing its status as the most leveraged stock play on Bitcoin's long-term success. On the other side, the bearish pressure is undeniable: S&amp;P Global Ratings' downgrade to \"B-\" highlights the financial risk associated with this heavy BTC concentration.\n\nThis unique clash of bullish accumulation and bearish credit risk is why MSTR is the prime battleground in the $200,000 Bitget’s Stock Futures Rush (Phase 3). Since these two pressures pull the stock in opposing directions, they generate maximum volatility, providing traders with an excellent opportunity to either Long the bullish momentum or Short the credit risk, relying on GetAgent to time the entry and exit points for a profitable trade, regardless of the overall market direction.\n\nWill MSTR's next swing be driven by Bitcoin's momentum or the S&amp;P's risk warning? Let me know your trade thesis!  \n[https://coinmarketcap.com/real-world-assets/microstrategy](https://coinmarketcap.com/real-world-assets/microstrategy)",

Yet your assets can remain fully protected. In 2025, a hardware wallet is no longer optional, it is the foundation of true self-custody.\n\nBut what actually makes a hardware wallet secure?  \nHow do you separate real protection from marketing slogans?\n\nHere is what matters when choosing the right solution for your digital assets:\n\n• Security standards that go beyond software  \n• Biometric or secure chip protection against physical tampering  \n• Offline signing that keeps private keys fully isolated  \n• Multi chain support for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, BNB and more  \n• User friendly access without compromising safety  \n• Seedless or advanced recovery that removes human error  \n• Future proof design that evolves with new threats\n\nWhy this is critical\n\n• Hot wallets stay constantly exposed to online attacks  \n• Exchange custody depends on trust in third parties  \n• A single leaked password can cost you everything  \n• Criminals target the weakest points in access control\n\nSelf custody means immediate, reliable control  \nNo approvals  \nNo permissions  \nNo gatekeepers\n\nAnd when your wallet is protected by your unique biometrics, the security becomes personal.\n\n✅ Only you can unlock it  \n✅ Only you can approve transactions  \n✅ Only you control your identity and assets\n\n2025 is a turning point for crypto security.  \nThose who rely on luck will face risk.  \nThose who rely on real hardware protection will stay in control.\n\nYour keys, your identity, your peace of mind.  \nYour crypto deserves Serenity sAxess.  \n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/serenity-shield/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/serenity-shield/)",

Once I understood those basics, the entire space started making sense instead of feeling like random buzzwords.\n\nIf you’ve been curious about the tech side but find most explanations too complicated or too “salesy,” this one’s written in plain language and connects all the dots.\n\nWhat helped you finally understand how crypto really works?",

    "selftext": "Right now, I’ve been noticing some interesting market behavior:\n- Gold is up significantly\n- Stock markets (S&amp;P 500, MSCI World) are also rising\n- Bitcoin is down a bit\n- U.S. government is still in shutdown\n- Another Fed rate cut is expected around late October\n\nHere’s my attempt at explaining what might be going on:\n- Gold is benefiting because it’s viewed as a safe collateral and an inflation hedge — it gains from both the government shutdown and anticipated rate cuts.\n- Stocks are rising not because liquidity is abundant, but because markets are forward-looking; expectations of easier money are priced in.\n- Bitcoin, still largely seen as a “risk-on” asset, is being sold to raise dollars amid short-term liquidity constraints. Hence the recent drop.\n\nIn other words, there’s a time-frame mismatch across these assets:\n- BTC reacts almost instantly to current liquidity conditions (USD crunch due to the shutdown).\n- Equities price in future liquidity (6–12 months ahead).\n\nWhat this could mean for the future:\n\n- Bitcoin — being less institutionalized and more speculative — reacts to short-term cash flows, not forward guidance. So until liquidity returns, BTC may lag.\n- I expect the U.S. government shutdown to be resolved eventually — like previous ones.\n- If rate-cut probability remains high or the Fed actually cuts rates in October, BTC could snap upward quickly, while equities may stay relatively flat (since they’ve already priced in the easing).\n\nTL;DR: \nGold is rising as a safe-haven, equities are pricing in future liquidity/rate cuts, and Bitcoin is down because short-term USD liquidity is tight. Once the shutdown ends and rate cuts happen, BTC may rebound sharply, while stocks may stay flat.\n\n\nThis is just my take — happy to discuss the fund flows/liquidity perspective and hear other viewpoints.\n\n",

In 2015 when I just turned 18 I bought 85 Bitcoin @ around 235 each with a $20k student line of credit. Instead of going to college I used that money to buy Bitcoin and when i talked about it back then everyone said I was an idiot for doing it. But it worked out great because bitcoin was still a nascent technology at the time. Along with holding my initial position I doubled down many times and greatly grew my stack.\n\nThe problem with buying Bitcoin on credit these days is that the free market alone no longer really determines the price of btc and you are leaving yourself open to being wiped out by a financial entities manipulation. There are lots of government, corporate and central bank games being played with Bitcoin today. In the early bitcoin days things happened organically, it was simple supply and demand that caused the btc price to go up and down. There was also the fact it was a new technology and even if there wasn't demand for btc at some points back then you could still say you believe in the tech and if the tech was solid it would pay off down the line and bitcoin will go mainstream resulting in the btc price exploding.\n\nWell that dream was realized and Bitcoin went mainstream. But the fact that bitcoin is mainstream now also means it has achieved deeper integration with financial institutions and the government. These entities are now manipulating the price of bitcoin like they did with traditional assets. Bitcoin can now have a manufactured downtrend in price caused by these financial institutions. Let's say you buy bitcoin on credit one day, you could be wiped out and lose everything not because of organic sell pressure but because of government/tradfi manipulation pushing the price down. This wasn't a problem back then but it is now. They have enough money to decide when btc pumps and when it dumps because they literally print fiat and unfortunately many in the space today only care about btc going up so they can dump it for fiat. This plays directly into the hands of the financial institutions and central banks. These are the entities that cause recessions, maybe they create another one once you buy on credit and you get wiped out that way. So these days it could be better to buy btc with your own money instead of on credit, so even if there is a downtrend you can still keep your btc and ride it to $1m per coin instead of having to sell it in a downtrend to pay off your credit resulting in you missing gains.\n\nAlso 10 years ago when Bitcoin was $200 each the marketcap was 3 billion, today the Bitcoin marketcap is 2.4 trillion. Almost 1000x bigger. Orders of magnitude of more money needs to be put into bitcoin today to move it the exact same percentage as back then. in 2015 if btc marketcap went up another 3 billion that would double the price. Today for the price to double another 2.4 Trillion needs to be added to the marketcap. Of course literally $2.4 T dollars don't need to be injected but you get what I'm saying, we're on a bigger scale now and it takes much more to move the price. We aren't seeing frequent 40% daily pumps and weekly 10x increase in price anymore for a reason.\n\nFor clarification I still think btc is going to $1m per bitcoin, so of course if you time your credit buys properly you'll come out ahead but do you really think you can time it? The risk of getting caught in a downturn is really big and that could wipe you out.\n\nAnd sorry if this seemed like a doomer post, I don't want this to be taken as a bearish post because I'm still super bullish on Bitcoin and always have been. I just think the central banks are now greatly manipulating bitcoin and wiping people out so they can get even more of peoples bitcoin and control the supply as much as possible. This is all a big plan by them to manipulate Bitcoin like they do everything else, they don't want people owning btc they want it all for themselves. A lot of these ETFs, btc treasuries and other recent tradfi integrations of bitcoin will be used by the government to control the supply of Bitcoin.\n\nAnd even though I say the risk of buying credit on bitcoin is huge today and I wouldn't recommend it some part of me still wants to beat this government and tradfi trash that is trying to corrupt Bitcoin lol. I think I can beat them at their own game so I still have some credit btc positions open. I'm happy I was able to use the tradfi system against them back then and use their credit to purchase real currency btc. That's really the moral in all this, going against fiat and doing your best to make Bitcoin prevail.",

    "selftext": "Kendu has finally broken out of its long downtrend and reclaimed the 0.000015 range. That level acted as resistance for months and is now holding as support. The price structure has tightened, volume is stabilizing, and selling pressure has nearly vanished. It looks like the quiet stage before a proper move.\n\nThe strongest part of this setup isn’t the chart, it’s the holders. Almost 9,000 wallets have held Kendu for more than a year, and around 5,000 for six to twelve months. That is rare. It means a huge part of the supply sits with people who already proved they don’t panic-sell. When long-term conviction holders dominate the base, breakouts usually last longer.\n\nThe distribution looks natural. No giant bundles, no contract manipulation, no suspicious inflows. Just a steady curve of real EOAs holding through the cycle. The mix of short-term wallets keeps liquidity moving while the long-term ones anchor the floor. That balance is exactly what defines the early phase of a cult coin, organic growth that forms its own rhythm.\n\nKendu’s identity gives it an edge too. It has turned into a shared brand people can actually build around. You see it in the community projects, the small Kendu-branded products, and the memes that keep spreading on their own. It’s the kind of ecosystem that grows from participation, not marketing.\n\nThe broader market timing lines up. Bitcoin and Ethereum are trending up, smaller caps are starting to wake, and liquidity is rotating back into memes. When that happens, the coins with clean supply and strong communities usually move first.\n\nKendu went through silence, held its structure, and is still standing with a chart that finally flipped back to strength. There are very few coins with that kind of survival record this year.\n\nThis isn’t hype or advice, it’s simple observation. The data backs it up, the structure confirms it, and the community still shows up.\n\nKendu looks ready for its next phase.\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu/)\n\n[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu)",

    "title": "Is the Universal Collateral Approach a Good Approach in DeFi?",
    "selftext": "I've spent a fair bit of time in DeFi, experimenting with various collateralized lending and stablecoin protocols to see what holds up during market swings, and the universal collateral model in projects like Falcon Finance has me thinking it's a solid evolution if executed right. By allowing users to convert any liquid asset digital cryptos, fiat-backed tokens or tokenized RWAs into USD pegged liquidity through minting USDf, an overcollateralized synthetic stable, it broadens accessibility beyond the usual ETH or BTC dominance. The active management of that collateral via strategies such as basis spreads, funding rate arbitrage on both sides, cross-exchange arb, and native staking adds a layer of yield optimization that feels more proactive than what I've seen in simpler vaults on platforms like MakerDAO, potentially reducing liquidation risks while keeping things efficient.\n\nThat said, the sUSDf extension, where you stake USDf for a yield bearing version with institutional-grade strategies and APY boosts for fixed-term locks, appeals to my preference for set-it-and-forget-it farming without constant monitoring. The $FF token underpins governance, rewards and exclusive access, which could foster better alignment if the community stays engaged. I caught wind that it got listed on Binance yesterday after a short delay and it's also on Bitget with a launchpool where you can lock BGB or FF to farm tokens until tomorrow. Curious if folks here think this approach mitigates some of DeFi's fragmentation issues, or how it fares against competitors like Abracadabra or Reflexer?\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/falcon-finance-ff/",

While speculative flows play a role, the bigger story lies in how adoption of Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions can translate into real usage for the token.\n\nA major catalyst has been Bitlight’s airdrop program, with over 50% of supply allocated to ecosystem incentives for RGB holders and early adopters. These rewards mirror the playbook used by early DeFi projects to bootstrap activity. At the same time, the recent bitget candyBomb event has added visibility and participation from a wider base of retail traders, showing how exchange-driven momentum can layer onto organic ecosystem growth. The risk, of course, is whether demand can keep pace with ongoing unlocks.\n\nLooking further ahead, Bitlight’s $9.6 million funding round is fueling RGB-Lightning integration, aiming to combine smart contracts with the Lightning Network for instant stablecoin payments.

That sets it apart from most other meme coins.\n\n2. Fair Launch &amp; Community First •\tNo premine •\tNo team allocation •\t100% airdropped to the community This gives $DOG strong grassroots support and avoids the classic “dev dump” issue.\n\n3. Fixed Supply (100B)\n\nEveryone knows the total supply upfront. No hidden inflation, no surprises.\n\n4. Growing Interest\n\nSome institutions and public companies have already started accumulating, which helps with legitimacy and liquidity.\n\n5. Tied to Bitcoin’s Momentum\n\nWhen Bitcoin does well, $DOG can ride the wave since it’s Bitcoin-native. Strong BTC = more attention on $DOG.\n\n6. Meme Power + Community Hype\n\nLike all meme coins, community + virality matter. $DOG is already picking up speed as “the Dogecoin of Bitcoin.”\n\n7. Accessible Speculation\n\nIt’s cheap enough for small investors to grab a bag and hope for outsized gains — the same recipe that has fueled other meme runs.\n\n8. Different From the Rest\n\nMost meme coins live on Ethereum or Solana. $DOG is Bitcoin-native, which gives it a unique narrative in a crowded market.\n\n⸻\n\nTL;DR: $DOG = Meme coin + Bitcoin security + Fair launch + Strong community + Fixed supply. Not financial advice, but the upside case is clear.\n\nMajor community on X\n\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dog-go-to-the-moon-rune/",

    "title": "Lets Talk About Distribution",
    "selftext": "Distribution is arguably one of the most important factors when predicting which coin will be the next to truly pop off. These crazy week long pumps happen due to many factors such as **people FOMOing, reduced sell pressure** and a few others that tbh aren't as important as the other 2.\n\n**So What Would Make a Coin Have Reduced Sell Pressure?**\n\nWell sell pressure is just due to holders becoming disinterested or losing faith in a project but tbh in many cases it is due to impatience and wanting to chase the next big thing and this causes them to get wrecked often. There are countless posts on Reddit about how people sold Shib before the pump, unfortunately redistribution can be and is often a brutal period and many coins die but the ones that don't usually thrive after. If you look at the big memes you will see examples of this redistribution where the chart is just flat or even going down for months on end.\n\nHowever this is just tokens swapping hands to people who will not sell and guess what happens when people don't sell...sell pressure becomes non existent.\n\n**So What Would Cause People To Fomo?**\n\nGreen attracts green, people run at the first sign of green trying to catch the next best thing, obviously those who were holding before the pump make far more as many miss the majority of the pump but still FOMO is mainly due to things running, which is again linked to sell pressure.\n\n**The Below Figure Shows Which Coins Have the Most Diamond Handed Holders**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/492rqqgxcoqf1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f2746c6e2caf17ee5be1f9ea85f8a7e0b115807\n\nLook at Kendu, it stands out amongst the rest by far having the most percentages held for the longer period of times. This clearly shows a quite large price recalibration will be happening soon, sell pressure is gonna be nonexistent and FOMO will come fast. Kendu is unstoppable on many metrics and here is another one. \n\nIMO the next coin to pump to crazy levels will be Kendu and as discussed you wanna be here before this happens to get the max gains.\n\nETH: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18\n\nSOL: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45\n\nBASE: 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7\n\nCG: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu)\n\nCMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)",

    "title": "This can be the future paradigm of blockchain *IF DONE PROPERLY*.",
    "selftext": "A recurring challenge that I find from the way I see these blockchain economics is the sustainability of security budgets and the alignment of validator incentives with real network needs. As you all know, bitcoin faces long-term uncertainty as block subsidies decline, leaving security to depend on transaction fees that are volatile and insufficient if low demand periods are going to come around. Ethereum, while moving toward a rollup-centric model, still exhibits tension between how their token valuation is getting, validator incentives, and scalability. Stakers earn rewards for idle capital rather than for contributing through mostly verifiable services (as with higher capital, incentive solutions tends to viable contribute more even when the security level is not high), while MEV extraction distorts the incentive structure. Both systems highlight an unresolved issue: how to evaluate the network's asset to increase valuation, perform greater scalability, and help making security to be more proactive in a way that is all combined together in a sustainable and tending towards an adaptative, structural way. \n\nIf you were to think about a model that combines scarcity-anchored issuance that works around measuring economic metrics instead of security producing the issuance, with what I call a proof of doing the \"work\". Instead of issuance being fixed or governed arbitrarily, it becomes demand-responsive within a scarcity model in bound. When demand rises, issuance adjusts upward to fund validator rewards and maintain decentralization. When demand falls, issuance contracts, that might have the security to be less incentivized, but it is preserving the scarcity narrative and protecting asset valuation. This might be really hard and researchers need to be more precautious and research on how this can be implemented. At the end, this introduces an elastic, bounded security budget that is both countercyclical and adaptive, responding to real usage rather than speculation or rigid schedules.\n\nThis kind of consensus extends this by changing how validator rewards are allocated. Rather than simply compensating validators for capital locked in staking, rewards are distributed based on verifiable work (and you can think of work off-chain that is tied to the blockchain usage) that contributes directly to network health and scalability. Examples might include oracle verification, data security, verifying economic metrics, and so many you could think of. The idea is to tie protocol-level incentives to measurable services that improve user experience, security, and throughput, aligning economic rewards with ecosystem growth.\n\nThis approach addresses several long-standing problems. It mitigates security budget decay by ensuring validator incentives do not collapse when fee revenue is insufficient. It reduces misaligned incentives by rewarding productive contributions rather than passive capital. It introduces a scalable elasticity, allowing the system to increase effective throughput when demand and validator capacity justify it, without resorting to arbitrary block size increases. Finally, by anchoring issuance to scarcity by analyzing demand signals, it stabilizes the relationship between supply, security, and utility in a way that fixed or purely speculative models cannot.\n\nThe main challenges are in the design details. Robust and manipulation-resistant demand metrics must be chosen. Employment must be verifiable somehow, without introducing prohibitive complexity. Issuance adjustments must be bounded and gradual to avoid destabilizing feedback loops. Access must remain open to smaller operators so that Proof-of-Employment does not lead to centralization.\n\nIf this process can be implemented properly, and these challenges can be solved. It can most likely solve the most fundamental problems in this space and make it last forever. It can solve the security prospects of misaligned incentives or even not having the ability to expand more. It also solves token valuation as the network grows \"sustainably\", scalability bottleneck where the network fees doesn't got to be magnificently expensive or doesn't run faster. And, if this incorporates utility usage for both worlds. It can be the new era of what considered to be the new essence of the global finance. But it just got to be researched further and working really hard to achieve this carefully. \n\nI am interested in hearing whether others see this as a viable direction for research and experimentation, and in particular what failure modes or design pitfalls might emerge that I have not addressed.",

    "selftext": "It comes down into thinking about what I've researched on consensus and issuance that generates the economy overall. When we look back at bitcoin \\~15 years ago (bitcoin was not the only one). The concept where proof-of any kind these days. It's consolidate under the security side to produce the coins in the blockchain system, which is consensus. \n\nIt is a great model for those dependencies on security to produce value. But, I would argue on how it's designed initiated the issuance of the ecosystem. \n\nWhat if issuance should not be tied so tightly to the act of securing the network? Security is critical, but it doesn’t necessarily have to dictate how new money comes into existence. The way most blockchains are structured, block rewards or validator rewards are the faucet for issuance, which automatically merges consensus and monetary supply. This creates a strong alignment at first, but it also forces the system into rigidity. Once issuance runs down or shifts entirely to transaction fees, security depends heavily on demand pressure. If demand shrinks, so does security. \n\nAnother way of thinking is whether issuance should live as its own autonomous system, adapting to economic metrics and long-term sustainability rather than only to consensus participation. Imagine if issuance could scale with real activity levels, with economic signals both on-chain and off-chain feeding into the system. The challenge then becomes, how do you include those signals without opening the door to manipulation or dependence on centralized oracles? Yet it seems like a research direction worth exploring, because it separates monetary design from raw network security, potentially giving both more room to evolve. \n\nEthereum and other chains have moved toward dynamic policies with things like fee burns or staking rewards, but the architecture is still layered on top of the old assumption that consensus must be the foundation of issuance. It works, but it feels more like patchwork than a blueprint. Bitcoin, in contrast, has the ultimate rigidity, which gives it credibility as “digital gold” but also limits how adaptive it can ever be. If we were to design from scratch today, with better tools, more data, and even AI models, would we still merge issuance and consensus together, or would we allow issuance to function as its own adaptive economy with consensus as one of its many beneficiaries? \n\nThis is the core question I keep coming back to. We know the trade-offs: trust, simplicity, and predictability versus adaptability, sustainability, complexity, and responsiveness. But given how much the environment has changed since \"2000s\", is it time to think about issuance not as a byproduct of securing the chain, but as a parallel system that evolves with the network with real-world use case and the broader economy it exists in?",

    "selftext": "With Bitcoin being up 5% and Ethereum being up 8.65% over the past week and with rate cuts coming along with \"Uptober\" it is safe to say that people are very excited and optimistic for Q4.\n\nIMO for the average investor Bitcoin and Ethereum along with other large caps just aren't the best option due to their already large market cap and limited return potential. Yes they practically guarantee strong results investing $1000 into Bitcoin or Ethereum is not gonna be life changing at all, yes it may buy you some nice clothes or help fund a holiday but its not gonna change your life and bull runs have historically arrived every 4 years.\n\nIMO smaller cap memes not memes over 500 million market cap valuation at the time of writing this because they have very limited return potential. The majority of the gains have unfortunately passed and many new investors could very well just be exit liquidity... Coins like Shib have already had their day and it is time for a new coin to reach heights.\n\nThis is why I recommend you buy **Kendu.**\n\nKendu at the time of writing is sitting at 13.5 million market cap and statistically has the strongest community on social media rn, which can be easily spotted by going on X, memecoin subreddits like this one and other social media apps.\n\nKendu is also revolutionising the game with our insane selection of IRL efforts all created by the average holder and not some team.\n\nWhen retail arrived in 2021, there was not presidential rug pulls, celebrity rug pulls and other bad actors. So unfortunately they are not gonna dive into projects wildly\n\nHowever Kendu counters these doubts with **Proof of Humanity** and longstanding initiatives all under the Kendu umbrella, the Kendu community is real and we are not going anywhere.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ycq1sfvhqxof1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4d0f781785e14c78eb14f911df53f16dd0925b4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k5b6hu8jqxof1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fde777c76c5fcaeb2a536cd99fddc2f7feee85e\n\nKendu is gonna be one of the biggest gainers in the retail wave and to put it into perspective Shib 1000x in just over 30 days, that's how fast things move in crypto...\n\nJoin our telegram and ask any questions you want, the results will be inevitable with or without you, imo it is crazy to not at least invest $15 into Kendu, imo you really cannot lose at these levels.

    "title": "Watching $PTB Shape Into Something Interesting",
    "selftext": "Over time I have learned that the way I approach tokens keeps changing. At first, I was only focused on the price chart, trying to catch entries and exits. But lately, I have started to notice how some projects push me to think a bit wider, not just about what I can make from a trade but also how I can position myself while things are still forming.\n\nThat’s how I’ve been looking at $PTB. When it launched I didn’t pay it much mind beyond curiosity. But as I kept checking the numbers, the picture started to shift. I saw it closing a day with a price around $0.0256, and now it’s sitting around $0.0537.  a 109% move already, and even though numbers on their own don’t tell the full story, they do have a way of catching my attention.\n\nThe other layer is the launchpool on bitget, where the APR has been holding above 50%. And that creates a different kind of thinking. It is not just about watching if the chart can push higher, but also about how I can make use of the staking side while keeping exposure. That balance between trading for quick gains and letting tokens work in the background is something I’ve been experimenting with more often, and $PTB fits neatly into that.\n\nIt reminds me that trading isn’t static. One token can change how I look at my activities, forcing me to adapt. It might be early still, but moments like this show me why I keep paying close attention. Sometimes the story is in the chart, sometimes it is in the opportunities built around it, and when both come together, it becomes harder to ignore.\n\n[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/portal-to-bitcoin](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/portal-to-bitcoin)",

With enough power, they could crack the cryptography that protects wallets, private keys, and transactions. Imagine billions in assets suddenly being at risk.\n\nSome experts say we’re decades away. Others argue it could be much sooner. Either way, ignoring it feels reckless.\n\nWhat’s worse is that the conversation barely exists in the crypto community. We argue about transaction fees, scaling, or memes but the one thing that could literally wipe out the foundation of the entire industry? Silence.\n\nIf crypto is supposed to be “future-proof money,” then we need to be thinking about how it survives in a post-quantum world.\n\nCurious what you all think:\n\nIs the quantum threat overblown?\n\nDo you think blockchains will adapt in time?\n\nOr are we sleepwalking into the biggest security risk crypto has ever faced?",

    "selftext": "September has historically been a rough month for crypto, and this year is proving no different. Bitcoin and major altcoins are struggling to hold momentum, reminding us just how unpredictable the market can be.\n\nThat’s why I have been looking beyond active trading for ways to stay consistent. One approach that’s worked for me is staking. Instead of chasing every move, I’ve been using Bitget’s Launchpool to put my $BGB to work. From January through July, this gave me steady returns, even during quieter market phases.\n\nNow with new tokens like $PTB being added to Launchpool, there are still ways to stay involved in the market without having to trade every dip and pump. For me, it’s less about chasing hype and more about finding strategies that build stability in uncertain times.\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/portaltobitcoin/",

And for secure asset bridging, their trust-minimized BitVM Bridge provides 1:1 backed BTC assets like YBTC and YBTC.B, creating safe gateways for injecting liquidity and pursuing yield strategies in the expanding BTCFi space.\n\nNow, if you're looking to earn some Bitlayer's native token BTR, Bitget is the go-to platform it's not only the easiest for racking up rewards but also boasts the highest 24-hour trading volume for $BTR. Whether through their Launchpool, Candybomb events or community campaigns, you can participate by trading spots or futures or even locking up BGB or BTR to share in a massive prize pool of 3,921,000 BTR. The steps are straightforward and accessible, making it perfect for both newbies and seasoned traders to get involved without unnecessary hassle.

For me, Kendu will still reach successful targets according to my definition of success. Community is always the biggest asset because a coin isn’t dead until everyone abandons it, and Kendu’s community has continued to work tirelessly to make the billions happen. We will not give up, and we expect to only add to the number of people who are willing to give everything they can to make success a reality.\n\n# **History Lesson Continued**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l8mapdn7okkf1.jpg?width=2822&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c30b4e9f56b9abf06b3eecabf72a2296ac631706\n\nPengu also had a massive 90% drawdown in the current cycle. I am sure there were others, but the above happened in 2025. Additionally, as stated previously in the video, trials and tribulations are part of achieving success. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kwz6bvo9okkf1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2392a7341da78cbb87351c617eb5b45c7cf03ae\n\nAbove is an excerpt from the CEO, Luca Netz, announcing an upcoming AMA. He talks about the history of Pudgy Penguins. A CTO by a few loyal holders who made a public offer to buy the project. He notes about the internal struggles and shaken trust from the past. I would much rather these things not happen, but where humans are concerned, they appear to be par for the course on the road to success. Pudgy Penguins already had massive success with their NFTs, but starting an actual token and rebuilding required the dedication of ‘a small group of loyal holders’ to make their current success a reality. Convection takes belief and willpower, and in Kendu, we have been showing this for months and months.\n\n# Here are just a few of the reasons why I am treating Kendu as a soon-to-be multi-billion-dollar project:\n\n* It is possible (22 million to 22 billion in 36 days for SHIB, which did happen, and our very own Stayseaart witnessed it)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gm4buj8onkkf1.png?width=968&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b82e635b61f5837815b53a2e39d29b376086b4cb\n\n* Superior HHI Score, which proves decentralization and a fairer distribution (less chance of whales dumping the chart aggressively). \n\n[Includes LPs and CEXs for transparency and comparative consistency](https://preview.redd.it/gdsa5n5qnkkf1.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8419c554d6b056241f6186c8c97257de6dd9c55)\n\n* People have come and gone for various reasons (old whales selling, new life phases, focusing on different projects), BUT the output has only increased even through the necessary CTO\n\n[X data - Use twitter age account to see time frame](https://preview.redd.it/lxtcku0vnkkf1.jpg?width=2160&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=287c4ea6998e0ec1225fdcb5577c79574a107cc5)\n\n* Certik audit does present a level of safety and trust that any intelligent investor should look for\n* Increased output and growth on Reddit and dominating Stocktwits provides visibility\n\n[ST Blitz Success on August 20th](https://preview.redd.it/yog1qhuwnkkf1.png?width=534&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c451e5e162c5b058860fa21570116fcadf092c7f)\n\n* DCA culture is increasing and spreading to even more people\n* The Brandcoin approach (in my eyes) will create buy pressure, and I am betting that a couple of Kendu businesses will illicit a large amount of buy pressure in the future (I think a couple are already turning a profit) DYOR\n* The majority of my quants have said that the party hasn’t even truly begun\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/strl82hknkkf1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bd4dfc0a3281f2589fffc93698c30a9aa6bdcf9\n\n\n\n# Things I can’t control (many I believe will happen, just don’t know when):\n\n* When businesses will turn a profit (some already are) and buy Kendu\n* Massive volume and liquidity back into riskier assets\n* Quantitative Easing\n* Retail coming to crypto and ‘riskier’ memes in droves\n* The cycle length: is this going to extend, breaking the four-year cycle theory, and having time this cycle\n* Price or Market Cap \n\nPENGU, PEPE, SPX6900, SHIB, etc, have all gone through massive drawdowns and consolidation/accumulation phases for long periods of time. This is par for the course. They all sit above 1 billion MC. A community matters most because people ARE the driving force to ensure success when shit inevitably goes down. I know what I am doing and why; what are you doing?\n\n\n\nLearning about Kendu:\n\nSee my comment\n\nETH: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18\n\nSOL: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45\n\nBASE: 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7\n\nCG: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu)\n\nCMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)\n\n",

I found it feeling better moving with my own plan instead of following the crowd.  \n  \nNow with the $SAPIEN listing, I see another chance that fits my approach, Are you keeping an eye on it too, or waiting to see how it plays out?

    "title": "Any news about balances on OTC desks (since early August)?",
    "selftext": "For those who might not know, big institutions like Strategy and Blackrock buy their bitcoin 'over the counter' (OTC desks). Large trades such as these are NOT done on exchanges, and hence it doesn't affect the price. For eg, we recently heard about the [$9 billion sale of BTC](https://www.cryptoninjas.net/news/galaxy-digital-offloads-9-billion-in-bitcoin-without-triggering-a-crash/) without really moving the price on the exchanges at all. \n\nExperts can correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding of how this works is as follows: these OTC desks connect large whales (buyers and sellers) and execute the trade using the price on the exchanges at the time of the trade. For eg if the price on the exchange is $120k, the OTC trade will be carried out at this price without really affecting the price on the exchanges at all. \n\nNow the question is, what happens when the OTC supply runs out, i.e. When there are no sellers left (at the current price). The balance on OTC desks has dropped sharply, about 75% from over 400,000 coins to just above 150,000 coins. Not all the coins on the exchanges are for sale. When the demand outstrips the supply, whales will have to buy on open exchanges. This will create a [supply shock](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-demand-shock-uncork-btc-price-otc-desks-run-dry) (what everyone has been talking about for years). \n\nWhat will a supply shock look like? Well, there will be sudden increases in price, and with every new high (125k, 130k... 200k) we'll continue to see more and more sellers. The supply will never be zero, but the point is - the demand will be much much higher. \n\nI'm curious to know if anyone here has done more research on this, and can add or correct anything that I've written. I believe any further insight will benefit the community. ",

    "selftext": "Whether the market is racing up or dragging its feet, I have learned the hard way that chasing the perfect entry is a losing game. That is when I started leaning into DCA, and over time it just clicked. I would rather keep buying small amounts regularly than tie myself in knots trying to time every single move. If the market dips, I am picking up more for the same spend. If it pumps, I am still adding without second guessing.  \n  \nWith how far crypto tech has come, it is easier than ever to stick to DCA. Most exchanges and onchain platforms now let you set recurring buys that run on autopilot, so I can quietly build positions in the assets I actually believe in. For me, that is BTC with its 21M hard cap, ETH at the center of the smart contract space, and a few other projects that could matter years from now, all without logging in every time.  \n  \nLooking back, if I had been putting the same amount into Bitcoin every month since last August, I would be sitting on about a 30% gain right now. Maybe more, since some top exchanges like Bitget even add perks such as a $50 rebate in their own token $BGB just for using recurring buy.  \n  \nFor me, DCA is not just a short term tactic. It is a habit that steadily builds exposure to the networks, protocols, and infrastructure that could shape the next decade of finance. The tech behind it makes it even harder to stop.\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitget-token-new](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitget-token-new)",

    "title": "Many experts seem increasingly convinced that quantum computing may never break current cryptography",
    "selftext": "I commented on some random post in this sub, about how a growing number of quantum computing experts are speaking up about what **could** even be a fundamental limit baked into the universe, prohibiting quantum computing from *ever* reaching close to a billion coherent physical quibits required to break elliptic curve public key encryption, or symmetric encryption. \n\n(Specifically something like 10^7 to 10^8 qubits including error correction.)\n\nIf true, that would mean all cryptocurrency is literally forever safe from quantum attacks. (Which is not the same as \"forever safe\".)\n\nLinks to those expert observations, below. \n\n(Disclaimer: I'm not an expert, to be clear. I'm just a curious nerd, scifi geek, and former programmer who started with assembler on embedded systems - who has researched the field from the outside for &gt;ten years - out of intense curiosity, as part of my former career in tech leadership, and also looking for the next big investment opportunity. This s--t is the closest we've come to magic as a species, so I don't know how to keep this short - so by all means, scroll to the next post if you don't like long-form content. Or just skip to the links section, that's the core point.)\n\n# In the beginning\n\nA \"universal limit until the end of time\" isn't how everyone expresses it. (The \"limit\" being, some arbitrary maximum number of coherent qubits in a compute system the universe will \"allow\".)\n\nSome experts in the links below just complain about the hype, FUD, and huge scams siphoning off capital, grants, and talent. A \"universal limit forever\" is how I like to aggregate the various criticisms in my own mind, and is a fun, playful way to think about it.\n\nSome do hint at such an idea though, for example a quantum noise floor baked into the fabric of the universe preventing coherence at large enough scales to be broadly useful, that can never be overcome by any technology, any more than a photon can escape the event horizon of a black hole (assuming our understanding of the most basic laws of physics are close enough).\n\nIMO, even honest experts may be unwittingly, passively helping to perpetuate the hype and FUD, by not actively pushing back on it. Whether due to \"just in case I'm wrong\" (a legitimate concern); or because helping their crypto project appear \"tough\" on the perceived threat is less of a headache than trying to educate legions of passionately misinformed stakeholders (and/or shareholders) that may never accept it anyway; or to just not risk their careers and pensions by being the lone neck sticking up to be cut. I don't know. I don't pretend to know that anyone is even fretting over it like this.\n\n(I mean - jfc this is nearly incomprehensible voodoo, wielding a field of science that even Feynman asserted that no one can really understand. Meanwhile we can't even agree that the Earth isn't flat. Let's be honest with ourselves - civilization is way more likely to end in \"Idiocracy\", than \"The Terminator\".)\n\n# The problem in a nutshell\n\n(To my non-expert understanding.)\n\nThe number of error-corrected qubits required to break 2048-bit RSA with Shor's algorithm, for example, is estimated to be something around 2,500 coherent, partially entangled qubits - still wildly out of reach for now.\n\nBut it gets way, way worse: that's *logical* qubits. Each individual logical qubit requires a lattice of *thousands to millions of physical qubits*, for error correction. For each logical qubit. That gets us into 10^7 to 10^8 total coherent physical quibits. \n\nThe depth of Toffoli gates used for Shor's and Grover's algorithms, for example, runs into the *trillions*, around 10^12. This extreme circuit depth means the required error correction overhead explodes, indirectly driving the physical qubit count into impractical territory.\n\nAlso, symmetric encryption like AES-256 (for TLS/HTTPS, wifi, disk encryption, etc.) has never really been considered at grave risk to quantum computing in the first place. Even before the hype, many experts already considered it \"post-quantum\", even though that wasn't the design intention. \n\nThe reason for that is, Grover's algorithm cuts the exponent in half. That's not trivial - every \"-1\" on the exponent, is a halving of the search space. But 2^128 is still an impossibly large search space. And if we really want to be safe, simply doubling or quadrupling the exponent again is a doable challenge for global web, banking, and comms infrastructure - as we've done with multiple global cryptographic upgrades in the past that were more complex than that.\n\nThe real magic of quantum computing is not mere \"parallelization\" - we can do that with silicon and distributed computing. No, it's the fundamental transformation of asymptotic complexity. \n\nShor's algorithm, for example, transforms a practically impossible exponential problem, into a polynomial one in log N time.\n\nBut it's only magic in principle. Grover's algorithm has only broken toy-scale versions with exponents of 1, 2, and 3. Shor's algorithm has only been able to factor numbers like 56,153 - so trivial it's solvable by hand.\n\nThe obvious argument against that, is that the same things were said in the early days about vacuum-tube computers with mercury delay line memory, running ~2,500 vacuum tubes. Back then, no one could have possibly imagined in their wildest scifi dreams, microprocessors with transistor counts approaching 100 billion; and not in a city block-sized bunker, but in the palm of your hand.\n\nBut there's a few problems with that seemingly reasonable argument:\n\n1) Not only has that *particular* human mental block been smashed, it may have set us up with unrealistic expectations.\n\n2) There is nothing like \"Moore's Law\" of transistor density, for quantum computing. Although qubit growth has been rapid in the low-hanging fruit phase, the laws of physics say we can't continuously double qubits every 18 months. Early transistors had no such limit, it was a \"mere\" ever-moving manufacturing challenge - which is why Gordon Moore was even able to conceive of such a seemingly preposterous \"law\" in the first place.\n\nThe fact is, rather than scaling exponentially, qubits become exponentially harder to increase in number. Error rates alone, scale up faster than linear growth of qubit count.\n\nJust as Moore's \"Law\" is finally slowing drastically due to bumping up against fundamental laws of nature (such as quantum tunneling and short-channel effects), quantum computing necessarily *started* at the limits of physics.\n\nWhatever gains in (announced) qubit count we have been hearing or will hear, will necessarily eventually slow down until it ceases to become an exciting focus of press releases. They'll probably concentrate more on something else, maybe frosted glass effects.\n\nEither way, when Microsoft or Google announces a quantum computing breakthrough, it's always expressed in raw, *physical* qubits. Not logical, error-corrected qubits.\n\nFurthermore: there's no such thing as a free lunch when it comes to quantum error-correction; nor cracking encryption at the quantum level without it.\n\nThere *are* however NISQ-friendly applications for quantum computing, where noise and uncertainty are features, not bugs. Quantum computing will continue to advance, even if a disappointingly low universal limit of coherent qubit count is proven or discovered.\n\n**Quantum simulation of quantum systems** may wind up being the only viable long-term use-cases for quantum computers; and in fact was the original motivation behind Feynman's idea of quantum computers. That's literally what quantum computers were invented for.\n\nFeynman never envisioned solving precise classical problems like factoring large numbers or cryptography breaking.\n\nHowever, several once-promising use-cases, like Quantum Chemistry, have been met with so many fundamental challenges that even their futures are in questions. \n\nBut simulating Quantum Mechanics itself, is already a groundbreaking application (with multiple facets). It is already *the* \"killer app\" of quantum computing.\n\nAnyway, you can achieve error correction with hybrid techniques involving silicon or other classical approaches (e.g. allegedly like Microsoft and Google's advances), but those involve massive bottlenecks somewhere along the way, which may only be worth it under certain hypothetical niche use-cases that have yet to be... discovered? created?\n\nAgain - you can't get error-correction for free, you can only push the problem somewhere else to deal with; and you can't break encryption without error correction.\n\nAs an example - with ~10^8 physical qubits, Bitcoin and Ethereum's ECDSA over secp256k1 transaction signatures fall to Shor's algorithm. (Not for free, and not instantly. But close enough to make cryptocurrency worthless.)\n\nFar less spectacular by comparison, symmetric encryption (for TLS, wifi, etc.) would become just a wee bit more easily broken via Grover’s algorithm (for example, essentially turning AES-256 into AES-128), with enough physical qubits. But the rest still has to be brute-forced the old-fashioned way.\n\nMonero is a just slightly safer. To first crack EdDSA over Ed25519 for tx signing, you'd first have to crack some of the blockchain in order to get useful inputs to attack.\n\n**TLDR**: the risk may be wildly - preposterously - overstated. A growing body of experts are arguing that the algorithms used by current cryptocurrencies (and banking etc.) **are almost certainly already quantum-safe**, and may be fundamentally so until the heat death of the universe - at least specifically to quantum computing.\n\n(And I don't know about you, but I plan to sell everything sometime before the last proton decays. And time the exit just right. Bonus points if the IRS is just a haze of unreconstructable Hawking Radiation by then [which means Hawking will have to be right about one thing and wrong about another].)\n\nThis says nothing about potential mathematical flaws discovered in some indefinite future, e.g. involving our current assumptions about the difficulty in factoring large numbers.\n\nAlso, specific flawed implementations (e.g. faulty RNGs) in existing algorithms have already resulted in exploits and stolen crypto. Such risks won't change, in fact will probably continue to get worse as cryptocurrency and third-party applications grow.\n\nBut to be clear: to my knowledge at least, there is as yet no formal mathematical proof, nor even testable theory, that puts a hard cap on the number of coherent qubits the universe is willing to allow in a single useful coherent computing system.\n\nCertainly, there is nothing as simple but mathematically principled as, \"based on what we think we know about the most basic structure of the universe, if a photon falls past the even horizon of a black hole, it's never coming back\".\n\nInstead, I'd wager FWIW that it's going to be a fuzzy line of maximum qubit count the universe allows, that we start softly bumping up against and can't seem to get across. Ever. Ergo (in this scenario), no quantum crypto-cracking, ever.\n\nThen the sun eventually engulfs the Earth. Still no quantum crypo-cracking.\n\nOur robotic descendants huddle around the last few husks of dwarf stars that haven't yet disappeared over the local spacetime horizon, and share a single complex consciousness in order to conserve energy for the long-haul of deep-time. Still no quantum crypto-cracking.\n\nThe past, future, present, space, and \"scale\" even the Planck Length evaporate. Still no quantum crypto-cracking. \n\nTREE(3) cosmological aeons later of nothing (except that measuring time or space has no meaning and there's no one to do it and nothing to measure with so who knows what didn't happen when), the universe spontaneously reboots for no apparent reason, with randomized laws of physics. (I guess all bets are off then, if those laws of physics allow for betting.)\n\nNo, it's more that the premise of quantum crypto-cracking seems increasingly unrealistic, according to said growing number of experts in the field doing the work, whom I'll soon stop hand-waving vaguely toward and actually list a few of.\n\nNone of this is to suggest that cryptography shouldn't always be upgraded when appropriate, balanced against performance for the use-case. Especially for new projects. There's no reason we can't or shouldn't upgrade \"The Internet\" and the global financial system, to be resistant even to fictional quantum crypto-cracking - at least when balanced with ever-improving [classic] hardware-assisted performance. (But do keep in mind that more complex cryptography also increases opportunities for flaws and exploits. I'm not qualified to argue that just increasing they key length of existing symmetric encryption algos avoids the risk of new exploits - but it's *an* argument.)\n\nBut as many of you are probably aware, there's a separate debate building steam, over whether upgrading Bitcoin's various cryptography could (perhaps ironically) fundamentally ruin it as a trusted investment asset, in one or more of various ways depending on how things like coins in inactive wallets are handled. (For which, as I understand it, there may be no \"non-awful\" solution if a crypto upgrade were demanded by the community to be executed no matter the potentially self-destructive costs. That debate and its merits are beyond the point of this post, mainly because I've just covered about everything I know about it.) \n\nSuffice to say, upgrading Bitcoin's multiple points of cryptographic tech is way more complicated than, say, major historical global upgrades to SSL/TLS. Not due to the tech itself, but the whole social-techno-economic-financial structure of the whole thing that is \"Bitcoin\". (Gotta be a better way to phrase that.)\n\nAnyway, finally here are the links to get you started down the rabbit hole. This is Conclusion Shopping at it's finest to be sure - because it's the point I'm trying to make. (And anyway we are all already exhaustively familiar with the counter-arguments so why waste time with that.)\n\n- [The Argument against Quantum Computers, the Quantum Laws of Nature, and Google’s Supremacy Claims](https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/laws-blog2.pdf) by Gil Kalai, Henry and Manya Noskwith Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem\n\n- [Why Quantum Cryptanalysis is Bollocks](https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/bollocks.pdf) by Peter Gutmann, computer scientist at the University of Auckland, author of cryptlib, SFS, and the Gutmann Method\n\n- [The Limits of Quantum](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/The_Limits_of_Quantum_Computers.pdf) on behalf of Scientific American by Scott Aaronson, professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT\n\n- [Scientific American opinion article doubting the attainability of useful quantum computing](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/microsofts-and-googles-quantum-computing-claims-add-to-consumer-confusion/)\n\n- [Debunking of RSA encryption having been defeated by Schnorr's quantum algorithm](https://github.com/lducas/SchnorrGate)\n\n- [Oxford scientist: Greedy physicists have overhyped quantum computing](https://thenextweb.com/news/oxford-scientist-says-greedy-physicists-overhyped-quantum-computing) Dr. Nikita Gourianov, research scientist in the Atomic &amp; Laser Physics sub-department at the University of Oxford’s Department of Physics\n\n- [Quantum Deception: A $2 Billion fraud built on fake products, fake revenue, and fake partnerships](https://www.capybararesearch.com/reports/quantum-computing-inc-a-stock-promotion-with-fake-products-sales-and-partnerships/)\n\n(Standard disclaimer: I'm not going to respond to trolling comments or obviously bad-faith straw-man slop such as \"That's too long I'm not reading it\", I'll probably just block those as usual to make my overall reddit experience cleaner.

But angry ad hominem attacks are fine, creative ones I can reuse even encouraged - as long as they are accompanied by even a mere *attempt* at a good-faith argument, however much I might disagree with, or not.

    "selftext": "In Bitcoin, finality isn’t instant blocks are added roughly every 10 minutes, and most people wait for 6 confirmations (\\~60 minutes) before calling a transaction “final.” This delay is part of its proof-of-work design, prioritizing security over speed.\n\nEthereum is faster, using proof-of-stake with finality in about 60–90 seconds under normal conditions. It’s a big improvement, but still dependent on validator messages propagating across the network and being confirmed in slots/epochs.\n\nBoth systems and most others share the same bottleneck: finality happens at the network/software layer, so the time it takes is bound by message passing, block production, and confirmation rules.\n\nNow imagine if finality wasn’t a network event at all, but a hardware event.  \nModern high-bandwidth memory (HBM-DRAM) operates in nanoseconds. If consensus checks were done directly inside the memory cycle, a transaction could be validated and finalized at hardware speed before the network even broadcasts it. The network would just carry the already-finalized state.\n\nCould this approach eliminate the network delay in finality, or would other bottlenecks (like I/O and storage) erase the gains?",

    "selftext": "First : yes, I use ChatGPT to help me write this, because I'm not a native speaker. Thank you for your understanding. That doesnt' mean I'm a bot ;)\n\n\\-\n\nIf you think Pepecoin is just another meme token riding the hype wave, you’re not alone. But take a closer look — **Pepecoin is nothing like the average meme coin**. No gimmicks, no smoke and mirrors. It’s a clean, independent blockchain with real intentions, strong tech roots, and a community that actually makes sense.\n\nHere’s what you should know, straight from [pepecoin.org](https://pepecoin.org/):\n\n🔸 **Pepecoin is its own blockchain — not a token**\n\nLaunched in **early 2024**, Pepecoin is a **standalone blockchain**, forked from Dogecoin (which itself is based on Litecoin/Bitcoin).  \nThat means it’s not built on Ethereum or Solana. It doesn’t rely on someone else’s tech stack. It runs its own decentralized network, with its own rules, its own explorer, and its own coins.\n\nIt uses **Proof-of-Work**, like Bitcoin and Dogecoin, keeping things simple, open and censorship-resistant.\n\n🔸 **No pre-mine. No ICO. No dev tax. No presale.**\n\nThis is rare: **everyone started at the same level**.  \nThere was no Initial Coin Offering (ICO), no privileged wallets, no marketing wallets, no sketchy allocation to insiders.  \nWhat you see is what you get — a clean start, and full transparency from day one.\n\n🔸 **Made for tipping, memes, and fun — but with actual utility**\n\nPepecoin was built to be **lightweight, fast, and usable**. It’s not trying to be a global banking solution.  \nIt’s here for **everyday peer-to-peer transactions**, especially **tipping** — the good old “internet money for cool people” spirit.\n\nIt already works on **Discord, Reddit, and Telegram** via bots.  \n**Transactions are near-instant and cost a fraction of a cent.** This isn’t a dream — it’s working *right now*.\n\n🔸 **Fully functional ecosystem**\n\n[Pepecoin.org](http://pepecoin.org/) gives you everything you need:\n\n* Official **Pepecoin Core** desktop wallet\n* Integrations with **Coinomi**, **Komodo**, and **Tangem**\n* A working **block explorer**\n* A clean FAQ and documentation\n* A growing list of CEXs\n* Tipping bots and developer tools\n\nThis is not vaporware. You can start using it today without friction.\n\n🔸 **Physical hardware wallets available via Tangem**\n\nYes, really: **Tangem released custom Pepecoin-branded wallets**, letting you store your coins in a secure, cold-storage smartcard you can carry in your pocket.\n\nIt’s more than just memes and logos — the team is taking usability seriously.\n\n🔸 **A meme with heart — and a good community behind it**\n\nPepecoin is built on the legacy of **Pepe the Frog**, but embraces the original meaning: **open internet culture, humor, and independence**, without politics or toxicity.\n\nThe community is **welcoming, helpful, and not full of elitist jerks**. You can ask questions, laugh, post memes, or get tech help — and people will actually talk to you like a human being.\n\n👉 **In short:** Pepecoin doesn’t promise to change the world. But it’s clean, real, fun, fast, and functional. And in the meme coin space, that’s already rare enough.\n\nIf you’ve written it off as “just another frog token,” maybe give it a second look.  \nEverything is here:  \n🔗 [pepecoin.org](https://pepecoin.org/)\n\nCoinMarketCap : [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepecoin-org/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepecoin-org/)\n\nAnd if you're curious, drop by the Discord or Reddit — the frog might surprise you.",

Nice pullback today. \n\nSome sell the news, but also some investors that weren't happy with how long this stage of the audit took. \n\nFor those that believe in the team and vision, this clears a major bottleneck and presents innovation crypto hardly thought possible. \n\nAnd they have a series of updates planned now that mainnet is within reach. \n\nBased on past history of deals with IBM and MBK holding from Qatar, plus Patrick Storchenegger from the ethereum board, they do know how to open doors.  Could be plenty of upside here. \n\nI've been holding and buying for years.  Can't believe it took this long, but they are in a great position.  Not to mention they planned for post quantum cryptography from day 1 which will be a mess for existing projects... and a hot topic that only gets hotter.  A worldwide issue that all systems must address. \n\nTake a look or keep it on your radar. I'm riding it out and still bullish. \n\nhttps://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/qanplatform",

Everything in crypto is now VCs selling money or memecoins dumping on plebs.\n\nWe used to think in principles and I think the market will soon again.\n\nAI is going to compile metadata and link real world identities faster than anyone can imagine.\n\nIt's INSANE that we built our industry around transparent blockchains.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Zcash 2.0 The Last 1000x\n\nSatoshi correctly envisioned a world in which unstoppable private money at scale would out compete the paper money of politicians. Bitcoin accomplished part of this vision. Zcash will deliver the rest.\n\n**Bitcoin succeeds as digital gold, a vital inflation hedge.** But it is neither private as pseudo anonymity has failed nor is it scalable outside of centralized structures like ETFs.\n\nBitcoin mostly complements the fiat system by making wealth seizure trivial through centralized custodians while leaving users open to physical attacks because wealth is broadcast to everyone on the planet. Individuals need privacy.\n\n**Zcash solves privacy through zero knowledge (Zk) tech and end-to-end encryption for user transactions.** In fact Zcash and similar Zk systems are the only private cryptocurrencies because they encrypt the ledger. Decoy systems such as Monero are broken because decoys moving across a transparent ledger can eventually be teased out. This flaw becomes fatal with AI coming online to automate the work.\n\nYet private Zk systems are notoriously hard to scale. They have state contention around unique identifiers called nullifiers required to prevent double spends and worse require all user wallets to download all transactions and attempt to decrypt each one to see if the funds are theirs. At best todays Zk systems are toys.\n\n*That is until Project Tachyon.* An Apollo Project for a free future run by famed Zk engineer Sean Bowe. The end point of a decade’s long research effort by the scientists and engineers of Zcash to scale private unstoppable money to the world.\n\nProject Tachyon resolves state contention while improving user experience because wallets no longer need to download all encrypted transactions. Check out Sean’s write up here.\n\nThe Zcash ecosystem is focused on shipping this new architecture within the next 12 months. The worlds first private money at planetary scale, a zero to one event.\n\n**Bitcoins serves as a public store of value for governments and corporations.** Individuals however need to store wealth privately to avoid wealth seizure, targeted scams and physical attacks. Internet native private wealth storage is easily worth a trillion. ZEC $50k the last 1000x in crpyto.\n\nMore importantly for those who came into crypto for the ideals of a better world in which individuals are sovereign, free to choose their associations, be safe in their wealth and spend their money, their life force, as they choose without the Panopticons approval Zcash is for you.\n\n**Now is the time to join the revolution. Freedom comes from privacy.**\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/zcash/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/zcash/)",

It’s a multi chain Web3 gaming platform aiming to feel like a centralized exchange (CEX) on the front end, while keeping the benefits of onchain asset ownership under the hood.\n\nThe platform is powered by the $ESPORTS governance token, which supports gameplay, rewards and governance. It also integrates Marmot Points and a YOOL utility token, creating a layered ecosystem. With backing from names like Consensys, Linea, and Google for Startups, Yooldo seems focused on solving Web3 usability problem.\n\nAn interesting angle is its collaboration with Bitget PoolX, where users can lock BTC to passively earn $ESPORTS, offering a low effort way to engage while watching the project develop.\n\nIt’s early days, but it raises a bigger question, can platforms like this actually bring mainstream players into crypto gaming without overwhelming them?\n https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/yooldo/",

We've answered some questions received via DM and are sharing them here for everyone. An AMA is coming soon for direct Q&amp;A with the team, but this should clear up some doubts for now!\n\n**Q1: When is sAxess Pro coming? When will it be released? It was planned for Q2, which has already passed.**  \nsAxess Pro is nearing completion. The API is fully developed, and the UI/frontend are in final refinement stages. We’re targeting release around **August 2025**.\n\n**Q2: Are there concrete plans to integrate sAxess with other services and/or wallets? Currently, it’s just a storage option without further functionality.**  \nRight now, sAxess offers storage and inheritance features. Our focus is on integrating various networks and their tokens, e.g., BTC. After integration, we’ll expand additional functionalities.\n\nsAxess Pro is evolving into an **enterprise-grade solution** with advanced storage and inheritance options. It’s designed to replace traditional 2FA and PIN systems, aiming at the **$10.5 trillion cybersecurity market**.\n\n**Q3: The $SERSH token is performing poorly, with very low market cap. Are there plans to improve this?**  \nWhile specifics can’t be revealed yet, we are actively planning initiatives addressing the current price and market cap. These will focus on boosting both **utility and sentiment** and will be shared soon.\n\n**Q4: What’s the status of the next roadmap steps and their impact?**  \nWe adopted a **regional strategy**: GCC &amp; Africa, Europe, US, and Asia-Pacific. This approach ensures targeted growth and localized operations.\n\nOur **decentralized physical infrastructure** is strengthening with operations in Chennai, Oman, and soon Amsterdam, plus agreements in other locations. This will enhance infrastructure, attract investors, and drive utility. After infrastructure, tokenization and monetization will unlock new opportunities.\n\n**Q5: Community enthusiasm feels low. While real achievements are important, some hype is needed. Also, withholding announcements until release isn’t helping. What’s the vision here?**  \nWe’ll hold an **AMA soon** to directly address vision and community concerns.\n\n**Q6: Any progress on new customers? Partnerships are visible but no new customers seem to appear. What’s the status?**  \nWe’re actively building a **robust distribution network**, including Amazon listings in multiple regions, plus retail and e-commerce strategies. Even small market share gains position us for strong growth.\n\n**Q7: How much does sBox cost? I’m hesitant to try a free trial if the price is too high later.**  \nsBox will remain **affordable after the free trial** to ensure accessibility. Pricing details will be announced soon.\n\n**Q8: When is the promised Staking Pool for April buyers coming? What issues are causing delays?**  \nThird-party issues beyond our control caused delays, but these are nearly resolved. We’ll deliver the promised pools and additional ones soon. Thank you for your patience!\n\nIf you have more questions, get ready for the upcoming AMA — your chance to ask directly!  \n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/serenity-shield/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/serenity-shield/)",

Curious if others are seeing the same?\n\nA few things stand out to me:\n\n* **Ethereum ETF speculation** is probably the big one. If approval lands soon, that’s a massive unlock for ETH and possibly a greenlight for other alt L1s.\n* **Bitcoin ETF inflows** are back, but ETH seems to be outperforming lately, could be early signs of a rotation.\n* **Fed rate cut optimism** has brought back the “risk-on” vibe across markets, which usually benefits alts more than BTC.\n* I’m also seeing meme coins and low caps getting attention again, like the early stages of a full-on alt season.\n\nDo you think this is the start of a sustained move for alts? Or just a short-term hype window around the ETH ETF?

    "title": "Why do most blockchains still rely on pre-quantum cryptography?",
    "selftext": "With the majority of blockchains today (including Bitcoin and Ethereum) using ECDSA or similar classical signature schemes, they are vulnerable to a sufficiently powerful quantum computer running Shor’s algorithm (which can run efficiently onto derive private keys from public keys).\n\nIn Bitcoin, every time someone sends a transaction, they expose their public key. That’s fine today, but once quantum hardware advances enough, those exposed keys could be reversed to steal funds - especially from dormant wallets that can't move fast enough to a safer scheme.\n\nI know that the narrative in the crypto space has historically disregarded the threat as being 20-30 years out, but with new advances in quantum computing seeming to come out every week, this seems to be more and more a present-facing threat.\n\n* NIST has already selected post-quantum signature schemes.\n* Google, IBM, and others are accelerating quantum hardware development.\n* Apple is implementing PQC in their iMessage service.\n* Lockheed Martin filed a patent to use QRL in communications devices.\n\nDespite all this, most of crypto is acting like this is a 2040 problem.  If we wait until there’s a credible quantum adversary, it will already be too late.  Wallets can be drained if even a handful of qubits scale the right way.  And with more and more Westerners putting their 401ks into BTC ETFs, it could result in a massive wealth transfer to an anonymous hacker group.  \n\nIs it time we treated post-quantum signatures like a necessity, not a novelty?\n\nWould love to hear your take—especially on implementation challenges or whether hybrid cryptography might be a viable transition path.",

An initial batch of 10 major trading pairs is already live (BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, TRX, XDC, ADA, BNB, DOGE, and SUI), and more pairs are reportedly on the way. USD1 is also tradable against USDT.\n\n\nWorld Liberty Financial, the group behind USD1, has direct ties to the Trump family — both Donald Jr. and Eric Trump are reportedly in management roles. Alongside USD1 (a USD-pegged stablecoin), WLFI is set to launch as the platform’s governance token.\n\n\nAccording to Bitrue’s CMO, the exchange is betting on USD1 to play a major role in upcoming regulatory shifts\n\n\n&gt;Now that the Trump family increasingly has skin in the game, we’re fully expecting to see developments in this area sooner rather than later.\n\n\nSource - https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/bitrue-adds-usd1-from-world-liberty-financial-as-base-trading-pair-4129355\n\n\nCoingecko Listing - https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/usd1-wlfi",

    "title": "Crypto Lesson: Don't Sell Too Early! (Personal Story)",
    "selftext": "# Personal Storytime!\n\nAbout 4/5 years ago we were closing in on the major top for the cryptomarket. Ethereum just dipped from $4400 to $1700, I thought the cycle wasn't over so I bought the dip. After that I got really anxious checking the price one too many times and couldn't control my emotions any longer. I sold for a 25% profit.\n\nThat mistake had cost me $70k profit if I just listened to my gut feeling and followed my plan of buying the dip.\n\nA little time before this incident I was messing around on Binance buying some memecoins. I found DOGE and decided to buy a bag and see what would happen. I bought $4000 worth of DOGE, after a couple of months, not much had happened and I decided to sell my bag at an break even point.\n\nThis mistake had cost me around $186k in profit, had I just stuck with my plan of ''seeing what would happen''. (If you dig long enough you'll find evidence in my Reddit history somewhere haha)\n\n# From Chasing Pumps to Finding Purpose: The Power of Real Crypto Communities\n\nWhen deciding what coin to invest in, I would highly recommend you to look at the lifetime of this coin. And see what has happened in the community, the Subreddit and the overal activity of this token. There are a lot of coin developers in the space looking to make a quick bag and letting the projects die out in about 1-2 weeks tops. Therefore it's safer to look for undervalued projects with a rich history and a strong and active community keeping the project alive. Communities with real people. No market makers pumping the chart or volume bots showing fake activity on dexscreener.\n\nI realized this after I was chasing pump and dump schemes after the whole $TRUMP coin incident, I wanted the quick money and ended losing money quickly. When I decided to search for a real community, I wanted a community with real people, having real conviction.\n\nThat was when I stumbled upon $KENDU on Reddit. I saw Kendu ranking in the yearly/monthly top of a lot of crypto subreddits. What I also noticed was that there were a lot of people being active while being fully doxed. When I saw people with actual Kendu tattoos (one guy with a Kendu tattoo on his private part) I knew this community had real conviction and will do everything to make this succeed. I was sold.\n\n# Why I bought Kendu?\n\nThe first thing I fell for was the IRL presence of this community. A lot of real people being active and IRL products like Kendu branded energy drinks. Besides that I was immediately sold when I heard people were quitting their day to day job to work full time on $KENDU. This community really is something else, doing everything to push this and making it happen.\n\nSomething that also stood out to me is the person who makes the Kendu mural art, StaySeaArt. She does all the art and merchandise design for Kendu. The cool thing is, she also did all the mural art and merchandise designs for Shib back in the days. She is also still a [r/SHIBArmy](https://www.reddit.com/r/SHIBArmy/) moderator.\n\n[Kendu Streetteam with StaySeaArt at the Kendu sponsored Florida Grooves Event ](https://reddit.com/link/1lzjrgz/video/ictm23rbqtcf1/player)\n\nWhen looking at the top wallets of Kendu, almost all top holders didn't sell during ATH, some even looking at $1M in profit. This confirms my gut feeling this community has real conviction.\n\nI bought the most of my bag around the $12.5M marketcap mark. Recently my entire portfolio was up +400% but I didn't sell a single token, you know why? Because I wholeheartedly believe this community will push Kendu to deca-billions!\n\nKendu has an ATH of $286M marketcap and is sitting around the $20M marketcap right now. If my math is correct, that's still a clean x13 gain till ATH. These are multipliers you won't get in Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\n# Alt-season on our doorstep\n\nA community is what gives memecoins value and Kendu has arguably the best community in crypto, if Shib, Doge and Pepe can accomplish the billions with far less money in the market, why can't Kendu. We are at the base of the biggest AltSeason in Crypto history, we truly have the potential to 1000x and in my opinion we can 3000x. Shib went from 22 million to 22 billion in 36 days, so why can't Kendu? It has already been proven that community is all you need by the 3 coins I have mentioned, so what's stopping Kendu???  \nJoin the Telegram and check out the community even if you are not a holder. We would love to have you.  \nSkip the Frappuccino and put the money into Kendu at the minimum. This is not an opportunity you want to miss.\n\nAll the signs were there...\n\n[Cheers to Kendu!](https://reddit.com/link/1lzjrgz/video/4yhcnzkkqtcf1/player)\n\nI want to sincerely wish everyone good luck for the bull run, no matter whether you are in Kendu or not :)\n\nWe Don't Gamble, We Work\n\n[r/KenduInu\\_Ecosystem](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/)\n\nETH: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18\n\nSOL: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45\n\nBASE: 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7\n\nCG: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu)  \nCMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)",

    "selftext": "What drew me to Kendu initially was the fact that I saw it everywhere, on all the crypto subreddits there it was. But it wasn't just the fact that Kendu was everywhere, it was the fact that its engagement was through the roof, yes some posts have more likes, but when a post has 700 likes and 3 comments it has obviously been botted. Kendu was different, the fact that they had a similar comment to upvote ratio, it meant that Kendu had a real community, not one propped up by bots, but real people. Social media dominance is so important for a coin, considering Shib, Pepe and Doge all got to the very top purely from social media efforts alone. Whilst Kendu is also changing the game with **unprecedented IRL efforts**, I am not gonna talk about that today.\n\n**Where is the Kendu Community Strongest?**\n\nKendu is strongest on Reddit, Stocktwits and Twitter, with the majority of our holders coming from Reddit(I also did), we however, also have a presence on Instagram, Warpcast and TikTok. We are probably the strongest community on Reddit, look around at the different memecoin subreddits and you will see Kendu posts with unparalleled engagement, we are also the strongest community on Stocktwits having just won a competition for $10,000 in advertisement credits. On Twitter we are very strong, it is obviously hard to say who is the strongest since it is such a wide platform but Kendu is up there with the very best for sure.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8lu1xkbl2gbf1.png?width=1284&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b060a482786ac2673faa63f8a8680feb667d1a77\n\n**Certik Audit**\n\nKendu is the 2nd coin ever to reach 50k Certik votes, Pepe is the only other coin to manage this. Pepe reached 10 billion outside of a bull run and was a huge success, this is just a sign of what is to come for Kendu. Kendu also has a Certik community score of 94.57, I haven't seen any other coins in the 90s, and Kendu is doing this under 20 million market cap. For example SPX has a community score of 84.57 and has a market cap of 1.17 billion. This shows how good Kendu is doing and in a space where community is everything, Kendu's potential upside is unmatched.\n\n**Why Social Media Efforts Are Important**\n\nCommunity strength has long been an indicator of the potential of a memecoin, with the memecoin giants all having an incredibly strong presence. Kendu is no different, we haven't had our major pump yet but we have the community to push us to the top. A strong community provides a coin with an unlimited amount of free advertisement, think of how Coca Cola pays for adverts even though everyone knows them. Since Kendu has been working so hard a lot of people know about us and are watching, they will FOMO at the first sign of green, you wanna position yourself before this happens. At the very least put $10 into Kendu, you have nothing to lose!\n\nWe Don’t Gamble, We Work\n\n[r/KenduInu\\_Ecosystem](/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/)\n\nETH: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18\n\nSOL: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45\n\nBASE: 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7\n\nCG: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu)\n\nCMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)",

    "selftext": "I came across an article from Samara that explains [Bitcoin Drivechains](https://www.samara-ag.com/market-insights/bitcoin-drivechains) in simple terms: It frames Drivechains as a way to enable DeFi, NFTs, altcoins, and experimentation without changing Bitcoin itself—essentially using sidechains with a two-way peg and blind merged mining. It also highlights the risks (e.g., delayed withdrawals, potential miner censorship or theft).\n\nWhat do you guys think of it?\n\n* Are Drivechains technically viable and secure enough to trust with real BTC?\n* Do they offer real benefits over existing Layer 2s or federated sidechains?\n* What are the biggest technical blockers to adoption (beyond political/social ones)?\n\nWould love to hear any perspectives on it.",

    "selftext": "If you're into crypto this is by far the best card. I've had it for more than 4 years and it's now the only card I use. Instead of points or cash back you get bitcoin or 50+ other cryptos as rewards back on every purchase. You can switch between crypto rewards in an instant. So if say Ethereum is down that day you can switch to the ETH which will get you more ETH as a reward. If you are feeling confident in Bitcoin in the evening then switch it back Bitcoin. You can then sell your rewards, stake them or send them off to a non-custodial wallet. This is by far the best CC i've ever had especially since I'm deep into the crypto world. If you are not, this CC is definitely NOT for you. The only con I have is with support. The email/chat support is abysmal. However, the call center is very helpful and always friendly. So i'd always suggest just calling if you have problems.\n\nAnyway, here is a video I made showcasing a little more about the card.\n\n[https://youtu.be/RsvS9rSM3cw](https://youtu.be/RsvS9rSM3cw)\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been following Bitcoin and crypto for a while, and I recently came across some discussions about quantum computing and its implications on BTC. One thing that stood out was a debate where someone suggested using quantum computers to recover stolen Bitcoin. Some argued it might be technically possible, while others pushed back hard saying it would be unethical and against the decentralized ethos.\n\nSo I’m curious:\n\nIs it actually possible to use quantum computing to crack stolen Bitcoin wallets?\n\nHow close are we to this being a real threat – or is it all just sci-fi at this point?\n\nWith the rapid progress in AI and computing, how can I be sure that my BTC is safe and can’t ever be hacked?\n\nAre there any steps I should take now to future-proof my Bitcoin security, in case quantum computing does become a real risk?\n\n\nI’m not trying to stir controversy — I’m just genuinely looking for clear and non-biased answers. I love Bitcoin’s principles, but I want to understand the technical realities and how to best protect my assets long term.\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "Hey folks, my name is Juan, I've been working in the software industry since 2021. I started out as a developer maintaining a legacy .NET app with infrastructure in AWS. That’s where I first got interested in cloud architecture, which eventually led me down the AWS certification path and into more formal infrastructure and DevOps roles.\n\nI’m deeply interested in cryptocurrencies because of their potential to decentralize and democratize transactions. I am venezuelan, and in 2017/2018 I was able to send money to my family through [localbitcoins.net](https://localbitcoins.net/) in a very difficult time when all international transactions were blocked, Cryptocurrencies were (and still are) a lifeline for many people. Btw, I truly recommend [https://whycryptocurrencies.com/](https://whycryptocurrencies.com/), really good lecture, it really inspired me to start working on this project.\n\nUntil I started this project, I felt wary of cold wallets, mostly because I didn’t really understand how they worked internally. I never felt comfortable with anything other than MetaMask (though I’m not a huge fan of storing keys in browser storage either). Another app I used a lot is LemonCash, which functions more like an exchange, letting you use crypto and automatically convert it to pesos while supporting different tokens, so I decided to build a desktop cold wallet in Go, something that sits between both applications.  \n  \n Investigating about frameworks I ran into wails, and I decided to start building the HD wallet, not to create a product but to learn in the process and get familar with the industry.  I've been building it since January, in the beginning I thought of supporting a few tokens (like USDC, ETH, BTC, SOL).  At the moment I have only managed to build the ETH infrastructure, but this has turned into the side project I’ve stuck with the longest.   \n  \nUntil now, I’ve been building it quietly and sharing progress within my personal network. But with the amount of time and thought I’ve put into it, I felt it was time to open it up to the community, get feedback, and maybe even find people interested in contributing.  \n  \nHere’s the repo: [https://github.com/deaconPush/ubiDist/tree/main/wails/wallet](https://github.com/deaconPush/ubiDist/tree/main/wails/wallet), and here is a video with a basic [demo](https://files.catbox.moe/x8pzhr.mp4).   \n  \nIt’s still rough around the edges, and as it is my first Go project the structure is still pretty raw. I’ve been focusing on keeping the architecture flexible and avoiding overengineering. So far, I’ve implemented a basic UI to create and restore wallets, store data in a SQLite DB, and send ETH transactions to other accounts using the local Hardhat network. Next steps include improving security, adding integration tests, helpful logging, and starting to add support for new tokens.  \n  \nI’ve always been a big fan of open source but never had the self-confidence to contribute, maybe this is my way into that world.\n\nThanks for reading, happy to connect with like minded engineers/crypto enthusiasts!\n\n",

    "selftext": "Been checking out some new launches lately and one that caught my attention is BSquared Network, also known as $B2. It just got listed on Bitget, so I decided to look into it a bit more.\n\nBSquared Network is a Bitcoin Layer 2 solution that aims to fix some of the major issues we’ve seen with the Bitcoin mainnet, things like slow speeds, high transaction fees, and the lack of smart contract support. These are problems that have hindered Bitcoin’s mainnet use, especially for things beyond just holding or transferring value.\n\nFrom what’s I have seen in their whitepaper, B2 is about 50x cheaper and 300x faster than the Bitcoin mainnet. It’s also built with added functionality that’s meant to make development on Bitcoin easier and more scalable. The total token supply is 210,000,000, and the ticker is simply $B2.\n\nSo If you're looking into new utility-focused projects, this one might be worth checking out. You can also read more about B2 directly on their official website.  \n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bsquared-network](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bsquared-network)",

Serenity’s **sAxess Card** is redefining how users manage and protect their digital assets — without compromising simplicity or security.\n\nAt the core of sAxess lies a powerful shift: **your fingerprint becomes your private key**. There are no passwords to remember, no phrases to store, and no backups to worry about. With a single biometric tap, users can access their wallets and authenticate transactions instantly — securely and intuitively.\n\nThis isn’t just a technological upgrade — it’s a philosophical one. In an era where **real-world asset (RWA)** tokenization is gaining traction and digital sovereignty is more important than ever, sAxess ensures **self-custody without complexity**. It aligns with Serenity’s broader mission to empower individuals with tools that combine **biometric authentication**, **blockchain integrity**, and **zero-trust principles**.\n\nAs Serenity continues to scale its ecosystem, driven by the utility of the **SERSH token**, the sAxess Card stands as a flagship innovation — enabling secure, user-friendly access to everything from tokenized real estate to DeFi platforms.\n\nNo passwords. No phrases. No compromises. Just **you** — and your fingerprint — in full control of your digital identity and assets.  \n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/serenity-shield/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/serenity-shield/)",

KENDU is a  Brandcoin propelled by the strongest community in DeFi. “The Kendu community is filled with talent, passion, and conviction. It is a community that is running it up old school, 2021-style. We are a sentient, autonomous, ever-expanding marketing machine that will not rest.\n\nJoin the movement! How will you use your unique set of skills and networks to build the biggest brand and legacy in #web3?” (Kojak797 OG Loyalist and one of the prominent voices welcoming me to Kendu and talking in a VC in my early days)\n\nHere and now, I believe Kendu is in a spectacular position in the market. I have been putting together these articles, which are a collection of the growing engagement and conversions of various CT crypto enthusiasts, with both massive to smaller followings, as a way to showcase the success of our organic approach. Please be advised that people are noticing, and growth will continue. As we continue to move up in MC and grow, more and more people will activate, be they new members, those reactivating, or those coming back and getting a bag again.\n\nPoint #3: EXPOSURE HELPS ORGANIC projects reach **critical mass**. With a low market cap, IRL growth and Social mentions spiking exponentially, holder count going up, creators posting with us up, and output rivaling communities with much larger MCs, Kendu is building towards greatness!\n\nThis brings me to my point: $KENDU will continue to keep growing organically, where holders will keep going up as the output of the Chads and Chadettes keeps increasing. **It is time to stop flipping for pennies when you can work towards the chance for generational wealth**. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ox6981667i5f1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80d7d7b6c25cdf516fa54be3b6df1013539bd2b4\n\n$Kendu is getting increasingly noticed, and this series aims to prove our conversion powers. Altsteinn has eighty-three thousand followers and has been posting about Kendu since 2024, but combing through the profile, anyone can see an exponential increase in the shoutouts featuring us. Topics range from positivity about our whales DCAing to us being the goat, to the above post recognizing our brand and cult like nature. Anyone can label themselves anything, but living your brand is what matters: actions speak louder than words. \n\nIt can start with a simple post, but when you see the movement spreading, pay attention! I start collecting posts the second I publish the previous article. While ordering this article, I noticed something IMPORTANT:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7aovcmg77i5f1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=204d8353723661d345d2a24c12287859979c0413\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bmb7eoz77i5f1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4fec57baebe78381a6f8692580542d0eb9e9155\n\nrekt\\_cooked quoted one of  altsteinn ‘s previous posts. Bullish\n\nThen primeblue99 quotes one of rekt\\_cooked’s previous posts\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/amxoprf97i5f1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19c9566a7178e110bdf69674a4e69bf40db34a72\n\nAnd then it continues here with moriarty\\_winn quoting the previous shoutout below:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vsspfdka7i5f1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0319edcae0ea1929f3b66ae81574ba1a8fc51070\n\nThe content of the posts should be studied! Remember, in Kendu, there are no paid KOLs with supply. Don’t panic, it is all organic!\n\nKojak797 already told readers, Kendu is running it up old school 2021 style, and it is working.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i8bzqr3d7i5f1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec22905df847f6f18f1fd11aa362c6eaac9570fd\n\nTokens can’t fake organic. Tokens can’t fake real. Tokens can’t fake having a movement. People are taking noticing and watching us like Anon\\_1000X. Kendu is as real as it comes, and we are spreading our Brandoin everywhere!\n\nSo, what do people find appealing about Kendu? Maybe it is the Ken-Du attitude:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i4rp2d0e7i5f1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=027e7d4ca1397323662c8bef28062958d37b5860\n\nAs cryptomalli asserts in the energy that Kendu brings, all humans could use such an approach in their lives.\n\nMaybe people like us because of the drive to win. Nothing can stop what we are building, and we won’t be stopped. We may not win every poll, but it is the expectation in our community that we should. With cryptonownever, Kendu showed up to Caden’s poll, and we won:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h8hd653f7i5f1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14bdf2be6e8716dcc50b5d594a0c177d6371362c\n\nFrom that win, it resulted in a video was made about Kendu. Don’t take my word for it, watch Caden yourself. His 12.8K subscribers on YouTube must be nothing.\n\n[KENDU: SLEEPING GIANT?!?!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxWrEOPbtWY)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/px067ieg7i5f1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a12e5def8d2a5aa68b7df35685fd8c01e466ec67\n\n5iveall sent out the above post about Kendu. Only in the second post, and they already know what we are about. More posts have followed because once you get it, Kendu is part of you. Welcome and keep that helmet on!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yily5tjh7i5f1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d16334ac5fea567055b310e99dde819615e166d0\n\nRieki\\_sol posted about us on Memorial Day weekend when things were slower, and we still showed up in the comments and raided. As a newer convert, they are already utilizing our catalogue of memes and content. I wanted to say welcome, and we hope you come into the TG where the main magic happens (if you aren’t already in it).\n\nThe next two posts track top communities by vote on their respective sites.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gelwo7wi7i5f1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2b7ee0d39a5ddd1d45077a86c3248795b908662\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/the-case-for-kendu-info-journal-v2-v0-qnuy3asij35f1.png?width=802&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bc18e369f0bba54229d8681fc58633c3d11967c)capitoday has 1.6K followers and a nice website where people must log in to vote. Full disclosure, I have not used this site, but some of our Chads and Chaddettes are, and it is keeping us in the top five\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dwxlwqak7i5f1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d629edf4679a4cbb632d6540b60000fbf12fe9ff\n\nCryptoSmallcap has 11.2K followers and is labeled as a Media and News Company. They have been posting about Kendu for months now, where we regularly land in their top ten. The profile does contain some posts that get at the heart and soul of Kendu, so worth checking out.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9v51zlam7i5f1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df5fbb9936e66a51daeedee841b2f8af1c046022\n\nTime to get into some numbers. Gem\\_Sheriff has a price expectation of 1 billion MC, but four days later, our old friend put a “Bull run target” of 5 billion MC. If you look at Gem’s profile, you can see that Kendu posts have been happening since the summer of ‘24. According to many, that is a low target for this cycle, but I agree that billions should be the easy minimum for Kendu to reach. Only work will get us there, and only time will tell. \n\nWhy such conviction and belief? What do some say about Kendu?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oucha6hn7i5f1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2489a486c2613e98f8d05235e2792c4316f9f49a\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/the-case-for-kendu-info-journal-v2-v0-zob75wenj35f1.png?width=802&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5127892efbfb3414d11b6f804c66d63aeff92a42)According to pepeisfriend, it is the power of the community that this personality believes has set Kendu up to be next, just like Pepe did. pepeisfriend has one hundred and twenty thousand followers, and this was the first post from this account, but it isn’t the only one. I would encourage readers to check the profile themselves and decide if Kendu has fully converted another CT personality.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/op2ifd2p7i5f1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40d49f69c9d391a88ef2d4d46706daefee3e5a8c\n\nWhile this is an older post, the chart is applicable and from my new favorite source: Guardian1771\\_. I have no idea when we will reach the next fib or when ETH will pump or BTC will make a new high or any of that, BUT I know all of the above will happen. As always, Kendu keeps working to grow the brand.\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/the-case-for-kendu-info-journal-v2-v0-x636oomqj35f1.png?width=802&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f22f9f6f71d026adac55da20703a31ca41a25c3f)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5xu3ehfq7i5f1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9842764fb0204389de8e2cba227df60cc1dbe3b\n\nI just have to leave the above reply to my reply to cryptojourneyrs' post about ETH. He has one hundred and thirty-two thousand followers and is a well-known and respected crypto personality who is aware of Kendu.\n\nIf you are looking for more information about Kend as you research, here is a Space from a massive account Officialtravlad: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9t2h9omr7i5f1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54dff13a7f62e5ee4a7ccec29f45b7aefc093ae7\n\nAt the time of writing, the post had 22.9 thousand views and 15.5 thousand listens. Additionally, Kendu is hosting a community space of our own at 5 pm EST today. (you can find it on X, 6/4/25)\n\nTune in or have a listen to learn more about Kendu.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jrlz7jqs7i5f1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41da3c36febf811f5e0755e1b1c13ae04a20188b\n\nSaving one of my favorites for last, Kenduraver is an OG loyalist in Kendu who has been around since the start. He took it upon himself to start the Kendu merch store around 5 million MC, and he co-founded KenduEnergy, our first true brandcoin product. This is the type of legend that works in Kendu, and he is one of the many reasons we are truly one of a kind!\n\nNo one can keep up with the output in Kendu as the work towards multi-billions is never-ending. And we are growing in important ways still. One such way is that the converts highlighted in previous articles are still posting about Kendu. That is what conversion is, they are now bull posting about Kendu since they got the vision. Now imagine what happens when some of those converts use the Kendu brand to build something on chain or off chain!\n\nPeople who understand how markets work and what it takes for an organic project to be sustainable are shouting us out more and more and supporting Kendu with investment, both financially and with their time. These are people who understand what a movement is and are experienced traders.\n\nVolume, holder count, and shoutouts will continue to rise, and MC will continue to stair-step up (it isn’t a straight line)! This is your invite to come, take a look, and see what is going on in Kendu because: We don’t gamble. We Work!\n\nSincerely,\n\nTheGDC33\n\nThe Metrics Master\n\nETH: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18\n\nSOL: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45\n\nBASE: 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7\n\nCG: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu)\n\nCMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)",

    "selftext": "**The issue**: Many tokens explode in price early or at some arbitrary date only to later collapse and never reclaim their all-time high. This applies not just to memecoins or purposeless tokens, but even to legitimate projects with real innovation and flawed tokenomics.\n\n**My proposed solution:** A design that converts chaotic momentum into stable, gradual growth using math and a touch of community coordination.\n\n**Feasibility rationale:** Tokens like DAI prove that the power of math and community can stabilize the price of a coin and peg it to a value. We can apply the same principle power with a different design but **instead of a stabilized peg, a stabilized growth.**\n\nI have in mind a complete technical design and the ability to implement it, primarily in solidity (for eth or an eth based chain). It is completely trustless with no centralized control and includes a semi-DAO mechanism where users can collaborate and direct the assets backing their tokens into permissioned smart contracts so they can capitalize on the assets they control but can't force use the assets of others.\n\n**Key Features/Properties:**\n\n* Tokens acquired directly from the protocol can have a \"forever break-even liquidity\" while the price is algorithmically designed to grow at a stable pace.\n   * (For a CEX to utilize this feature they would have to integrate the smart contract interaction. People who spot trade it are exposed to financial loses).\n* Token-backing assets are not trapped and can be funneled for utilization .\n* Protocol users can vote/vouch.\n   * Protocol fees for yield.\n   * Growth parameters (within pre-limits).\n   * Prevent the release of team tokens.\n      * Don't like the team? Vote that they'd get nothing.\n   * Funnel funds to an external contract using a minimum threshold at deadline logic.\n* Verify onchain a statement they made. An immutable proof that they said what they said.\n* A complete fair launch with a given grace period to join at the base price before growth logic initiates.\n   * A genuinely benevolent trustless design. \"A token Coffeezilla would be proud of\".\n\n**Reasons for me not to do it:**\n\n* I lack marketing skills.\n* I lack visual design skills (I can do a practical UI but not a conventionally beautiful/attractive design).\n* UX may be complex.\n* Team disincentivized. My intent for a fair financial design may discourage potential collaborators.\n* Regulatory gray zone due big brother progress proroguing governments.\n* Hard work and effort that requires motivation I don't currently have.\n* \"Too Ethical for Degens\" In this market, many people want to gamble and see 100x returns within a few days, they don't appreciate steady appreciation and those who do lean toward Bitcoin and large blue chip coin.\n\n**Reason why it should be done:**\n\n* Addresses a Real Problem. Offers an innovative low risk financial opportunity that is brave enough to see beyond short term greed.\n* Innovative Tokenomics\n* Built-in Integrity. Potential collaboration with Tegridy Farms.\n* Realistic semi-DAO features. Community-driven, but without the overly complex systems that open the door to protocol-killing exploits.\n* A fair, trustless, ethical undertaking.\n* Could be fun\n* Could be profitable\n* Within my capabilities if I find the right support\n\n**Thoughts?**",

If you look at the picture they are really close to each other.  Then you look at the other picture of the huge Bullflag and that would take it up from here around 18000%.   Either way you can see the current pattern with a large inverse head and shoulders that should be a 55% pump any day now.  In my opinion it has a lot of potential upside coming soon, especially with Bitcoin pumping and its large inverse head and shoulders formed and broken out of. \n\nCMC: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bonk1/",

Heck.. \"normal\" folks might buy BTC just to sell it to the treasury to get some BSR-Bills.\n\nI think I first raised this idea in early march in:\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1j3vgjn/daily_discussion_wednesday_march_05_2025/mg6ceps/ \n\nBut... wondering what do you all think?\nDo you think this would this be considered revenue neutral?\nWould you consider selling to the USG for some short duration TBills?\n\nI probably would sell some if it had a tax sweetener.",

    "selftext": "Most altcoins try to compete with Bitcoin or Ethereum by creating their own ecosystems—but **Koii Network** is taking a different path with **KIP-31**. Instead of launching yet another isolated chain, they’re proposing **Bitcoin-backed rollups** that use ordinal inscriptions to manage subnet permissions.\n\nBasically, Koii is forking a high-throughput chain (based on Solana tech) and anchoring it directly to Bitcoin. The twist? They’re using **ordinals**—normally used for NFTs—to register and permission each subnet. Wrapped BTC is used for staking, and state commitments are posted back to Bitcoin.\n\nIt’s an interesting model: rather than fighting for L1 dominance, Koii is offering a framework to build **programmable, scalable apps** that still inherit Bitcoin’s security. It kind of merges Bitcoin's reputation and stability with newer altcoin-level flexibility.\n\nHere’s a deep dive on how it works:  \n[https://medium.com/@bobnymous/unlocking-bitcoins-potential-how-peer-to-peer-innovation-and-kip-31-could-transform-the-ecosystem-cde8d879fc09](https://medium.com/@bobnymous/unlocking-bitcoins-potential-how-peer-to-peer-innovation-and-kip-31-could-transform-the-ecosystem-cde8d879fc09)\n\nAnyone else following Koii or experimenting with Bitcoin as a base layer for dApps?\n\nI'm not the author, I'm just doing research on Koii Network\n\nCG: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/koii](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/koii)  \nCMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/koii/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/koii/)",

    "title": "🚀 The Launch of Evrmore: Why It Forked from Ravencoin, and What Makes It Different",
    "selftext": "Let’s take a quick journey through the origins of Evrmore (EVR) — how it launched, why it split off from Ravencoin, and what makes it a unique evolution in decentralized asset creation.\n\n# 🧱 The Ravencoin Connection\n\nEvrmore was originally forked from Ravencoin, a project known for its decentralized asset issuance and use of the Bitcoin UTXO model. Ravencoin laid the groundwork for tokenized assets on-chain, but as the ecosystem matured, it became clear that a number of powerful features the community wanted could not be easily implemented within the Ravencoin network.\n\n# ❓ Why Fork Instead of Upgrade Ravencoin?\n\nEvrmore’s developers proposed several significant improvements to Ravencoin, including flexible metadata, permanent hashes, toll-based asset mechanics, reminting support, and more.\n\nHowever, Ravencoin’s governance model was resistant to these upgrades. Whether due to conservative development practices or stalled momentum, it became evident that these critical innovations were not going to be adopted within Ravencoin itself.\n\nEvrmore made the strategic decision to break away:\n\n# 🗓️ Evrmore Launch Overview\n\n* Launch Date: October 31, 2022\n* Block #1 Mined: Marks the start of the Evrmore blockchain\n* Consensus: Proof-of-Work (evrProgPow)\n\n# 🎁 Forkdrop to Ravencoin Holders\n\nTo respect its roots and bootstrap the community fairly, Evrmore launched with a snapshot-based forkdrop to all RVN holders.\n\n**Why this matters:**\n\n* **Shared Philosophy** – Ravencoin holders already believed in decentralized asset chains. Evrmore extended that vision.\n* **No Pre-Mine or ICO** – Evrmore didn’t sell tokens or give them to insiders. The forkdrop was a fair launch strategy.\n* **Community Continuity** – The snapshot ensured that early contributors to the asset-chain concept had a voice in Evrmore’s next chapter.\n\n# 📸 Snapshot Details:\n\nThe snapshot was taken on October 25, 2022, at 02:47:20 UTC, at Ravencoin block #2,510,000.\n\nIt included the top 50,000 RVN addresses with at least 2,673.14 RVN. These addresses were eligible to receive EVR.\n\n# ⏳ Claim Window:\n\nEligible users had 60 days from Evrmore's genesis block to claim their forkdropped EVR by moving it to a new address.\n\nThe claim period ended on December 29, 2022, at 19:07 UTC.\n\nUnclaimed EVR after that deadline was considered expired and permanently burned, reducing the total supply.\n\n# 🔎 What About the Genesis Block?\n\nSome people claim Evrmore isn’t a “real crypto” because it didn’t start at block 1 or didn’t create a completely fresh ledger.\n\nLet’s clarify:\n\n* Evrmore has its own blockchain, starting from Block #1\n* It does not share a chain or transaction history with Ravencoin\n* The snapshot was a one-time import mechanism, not a continuation of Ravencoin’s ledger\n\nSo yes — Evrmore has a genesis block: its own Block #1, mined on October 31, 2022. That’s the start of the Evrmore chain and its future.\n\n# 🔧 Key Upgrades in Evrmore (vs Ravencoin)\n\n* Metadata flexibility – Assets can update fields like ipfs\\_hash, toll rules, and more\n* Permanent IPFS fields – Lock data immutably, forever\n* Toll Assets – Asset creators can collect micro-fees on transfers\n* Burn &amp; Remint – Recover and re-issue assets sent to burn addresses\n* Expanded RPCs – Power-user and dev tools like updatemetadata, getcalculatedtoll, remint, etc.\n\n# ⚙️ Mining and Supply Details\n\n* Block Reward: 2,778 EVR\n   * 90% (2,500.2 EVR) goes to miners\n   * 10% (277.8 EVR) goes to the Miner Development Fund\n* Halving every \\~3.14 years (every 1,648,776 blocks)\n* Supply Cap: &lt; 21 billion EVR\n* First halving estimated: \\~Dec 25, 2025\n\n# 💬 Final Thoughts\n\nEvrmore wasn’t launched to coexist with Ravencoin — it was launched because Evrmore can do everything Ravencoin does and more.\n\nIt has the same foundation, but it’s more flexible, more creator-focused, has upgraded features, and is designed for growth.\n\nIf you’re building for the future you build on Evrmore.\n\nCoinMarketCap:\n\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/evrmore/",

    "selftext": "I recently came across an intriguing article that explores how peer-to-peer (P2P) technology forms the foundation of Bitcoin's decentralized architecture, significantly boosting its resilience, security, and accessibility.\n\nIn this article, they examine several critical aspects:\n\n* **Decentralization and Resilience:** P2P networks effectively eliminate single points of failure, guaranteeing continuous operation even in the face of attacks or outages.\n* **Enhanced Security and Trust:** Consensus mechanisms play a pivotal role in validating transactions without depending on central authorities, thereby enhancing security and trust.\n* **Financial Inclusion and Global Access:** Individuals in regions with limited banking infrastructure are empowered through the ability to conduct direct transactions.\n* **Lower Transaction Costs:** By removing intermediaries, transaction fees are significantly reduced, particularly benefiting cross-border transactions.\n* **Privacy and Autonomy:** Users can transact directly without the need to disclose personal information to third parties, ensuring privacy and autonomy.\n* **Scalability and Efficiency**: The distribution of transaction processing across multiple nodes contributes to the scalability of the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nAdditionally, the KIP-31 proposal from the Koii Network, presents a framework for integrating Bitcoin-backed rollups into the K2 network via a drivechain architecture. This proposal introduces the innovative concept of permissioning incremental subnets using Bitcoin ordinals.\n\nYou can read the full article here: [https://medium.com/@bobnymous/unlocking-bitcoins-potential-how-peer-to-peer-innovation-and-kip-31-could-transform-the-ecosystem-cde8d879fc09](https://medium.com/@bobnymous/unlocking-bitcoins-potential-how-peer-to-peer-innovation-and-kip-31-could-transform-the-ecosystem-cde8d879fc09)\n\nAnd the KIP-31 proposal here: [https://github.com/koii-network/koii-improvement-proposals/issues/31](https://github.com/koii-network/koii-improvement-proposals/issues/31)\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the current state of P2P technology within the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nWhat is your perspective on the potential implications of proposals like KIP-31 for Bitcoin's scalability and functionality?\n\nCan't wait to hear your thoughts and dive into these interesting topics!",

    "title": "“Memecoins are scams and Ponzi schemes!” — How to respond effectively",
    "selftext": "A lot of people see crypto as online gambling — almost a scam.  \nThen you’ve got another group: people who’ve understood and adopted \"crypto\" but only believe in BTC and a few altcoins with supposed “utility.” They think a token only has value if it’s building a new technology or tied to a big tech project, like the AI meta in 2024/2025.  \nThey hate, mock, and claim memecoins are scams, useless, and harmful to the image of crypto in the eyes of the general public.\n\n**Let’s break this down together** so you are prepared for the next time somebody wants to debate you on this topic.\n\nHere’s what we’re covering:\n\n1. The **arguments against** memecoins (some are valid).\n2. The **arguments for** memecoins and why they’re legit.\n\n**I. Arguments Against Memecoins**\n\n**1. “Memecoins are scams”**\n\nIt’s part true: over 95% of tokens launched are either rug pulls, pump and dumps, or slow rugs.  \n**But not all of them.**\n\nThe **pump fun** trend, which made launching a token on Solana ridiculously easy, has damaged the reputation of memecoins and also user mentality.  \nTokens like **$Trump**, **$Melania**, etc., didn’t help either — they made things worse in the eyes of the public.  \nThen there are influencers and groups like the Shib team who push pump and dump schemes and make tons of money off their communities.\n\n➡️ **The key?** Don’t jump into every trending token. These tokens usually have bad distribution and influencers will dump on you over time. Take your time to research a project, to jump into a TG group and get to know the people and their vision.  \n**Invest in strong communities** like Kendu — not in hype or influencers.\n\n**2. “Memecoins are Ponzi schemes”**\n\nThis is the go-to argument from people who hate memecoins. And I often see people not knowing how to reply.\n\n➡️ A **Ponzi scheme** is a scam where investors are promised a guaranteed return. That’s **not** what memecoins do.\n\nMemecoins are **speculative assets**, just like stocks, gold, fiat currencies, etc. The more people believe in the future of a coin, the more they buy, and the more the price rises.  \nBut everyone knows the price can also drop — even more so with memecoins.\n\nThere are **no promises**, just open market value.\n\n**3. “They’re too volatile, they always die, you have to sell before everyone else”**\n\nAgain, this fear comes from what pump fun caused. A lot of people lost trust in DeFi because of that.  \nIt became a race to sell **before** the rug or the dump.\n\n➡️ To avoid this, you should focus on tokens that have been around **for over a year**, like **Kendu**, which has an active community building the project no matter if the markets are green or red. That’s what makes it secure.\n\n**4. “Without memecoins, crypto would have a better image — they’re stupid”**\n\n**Wrong.**  \nIf memecoins didn’t exist, crypto would be way less known and less adopted.\n\nMemecoins are easy to understand and built around **community spirit**.  \nThey’ve already brought — and will keep bringing — millions of people into crypto for the **first time**.\n\nNow yes, I understand where the frustration comes from:\n\n* childish metas like fart/pee/shit/etc coins.\n* Celebrity scams/pump &amp; dump coins like $Trump, $Melania, etc.\n* Political/rac-ist/illegal coins like the na-zi meta or others.\n* All other stupid meta that will show a bad image of crypto to the whole world.\n\nI totally get why people are asking for DeFi regulation (even though it wouldn’t make sense in a truly decentralized world), that's why we have to focus on \"good\" projects to help DeFi for a better adoption.\n\n**5. “I only invest in projects that make sense — not some dog picture with zero value”**\n\nAh, my favorite one!  \nUsually said by people who feel **intellectually superior** — tech lovers, utility-maxis.\n\n➡️ Reminder: **a utility coin is worthless without a community**.  \nAnd it’s actually super hard to build a community around a purely utility-driven token.\n\nPeople buy in **before** the utility is launched and dump as soon as it goes live. Then no one cares anymore.\n\nUtility coins are often pure \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" plays.\n\nMemecoins that succeed often **build a strong community first**, and **then** develop a real ecosystem.\n\nTake **Kendu** as an example: right now, a **real-world ecosystem** is being built around it.  \nProducts, services, and companies launched by the community, under the Kendu brand:\n\n* drinks (energy drinks, coffee, tea)\n* video game studio\n* game board\n* Telegram bots\n* arts (murals, anime, music...)\n* events company\n* sponsoring sportsmen, festivals ...and more.\n\nA **true community empire** is forming. And only a **strong, loyal community** can pull that off.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qx3azqsz10ve1.jpg?width=926&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07995e7ecaa3477c431764a50f06406572ac45e7\n\n**II. Arguments in Defense of Memecoins**\n\n**1. The first memecoin in crypto history was Bitcoin.**\n\nThat’s right.  \nThe token that gave legitimacy to the entire crypto industry — now considered a **strategic asset** by the most powerful countries in the world — **was a memecoin** at the start.\n\nOnly the **BTC maxis** believed in Bitcoin for years and supported it the same way a community supports its memecoin. **Bitcoin has no more inherent utility than a basic memecoin** — its uniqueness lies in being the first. It's a speculative asset with no specific utility, but the community relentlessly pushed it forward. Today, it's the most important asset in crypto and is even compared to gold. **Now, do you see now the power of a dedicated community?**\n\n**2. They’re not Ponzi schemes, as explained earlier.**\n\nMemecoins don’t promise guaranteed returns. They’re speculative, open-market assets just like stocks, art, or collectibles.\n\n**3. Memecoins get their value from their community.**\n\nIt’s a **social and digital phenomenon**, not just economic.  \nThe value of any asset or currency comes **only** from what the market — people — are willing to give it.  \nMemecoins are supported and seen as valuable assets by their communities.\n\n➡️ If a community adds **utility** or **real-world value** on top — like Kendu does — the memecoin has strong long-term potential.\n\n**4. Thanks to their communities, memecoins are marketing powerhouses.**\n\nThey can draw massive attention to:\n\n* crypto in general\n* a specific blockchain\n* a new technology\n* or even real-world products branded under them (like **Kendu energy drinks**)\n\nMemecoins are **cultural weapons** in the attention economy.\n\n**5. Here’s something you can say to a skeptic:**\n\n“Yes, it’s speculative — but it’s not a Ponzi. It’s a community-driven asset with cultural and viral potential. You don’t have to believe in it, but some memecoins — like Kendu — have done **more** than projects with 50-page whitepapers.”\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nNo, memecoins aren’t perfect.  \nA lot of people and projects have **hurt the industry**, and that’s the main reason behind all the FUD.\n\nBut what we **can** do is support projects that truly carry **community values** — and ignore the garbage: the cringe names, the pointless hype, and the influencers dumping on their followers.\n\nIf a token just launched 10 days ago and it's already all over X — **you’re likely too late**. You’ll probably lose money.\n\nI see memecoins as a **real opportunity** to give people **financial independence** and even **cultural influence** in today’s world.\n\nThat’s why I believe in **Kendu**.  \nWe promote a fighter’s mindset — pushing to succeed in life with **respect, loyalty, and honor**.  \nWe grow stronger together, making each other better over time.\n\nIt’s real. It’s powerful. And it’s worth being part of.\n\n[r/KenduInu\\_Ecosystem](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/)\n\nETH: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18\n\nSOL: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45\n\nBASE: 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7\n\nCG: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu)  \nCMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)",

    "selftext": "I have kept a close eye on the development of restaking over a long time, and it has drastically changed my mindset regarding the use of my crypto. With traditional staking, people often find themselves with a feeling of passively waiting for rewards with little interaction, restaking however, changes the premise.\n\nInstead of just holding such assets like BNB or BTC, holders can maximize their returns by repurposing these holdings by means of restaking, which also supports network security. This approach is a better use of cryptocurrency capital. Projects like KernelDAO are promoting this approach on different blockchain systems, with over $2 billion of staked capital and offering a much better option than traditional staking products.\n\nThis reminds me of what similar projects like Lido are doing with Ethereum, however, KernelDAO elevates this idea further by taking it to different networks.\n\nAnother beneficial point is that Biitget is taking steps to improve access to such projects, especially in regions that are poorly served by other exchanges. One example of another approach to engaging users is KernelDAO's CandyBomb event.\n\nRestaking seems to be a wiser use of crypto since staking now means more than just holding onto tokens.\n\nDo you view restaking as an important innovation, or is it just an incremental change over what exists?\n\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kerneldao/",

The idea was simple: tap into the incredible intelligence of advanced LLM models and let them guide my crypto trades. I've been feeding these models tons of crypto data, fine-tuning them specifically for market moves. To avoid bias from any single model, I'm actually using multiple cutting-edge LLMs and combining their predictions into one solid trading signal. All process are systematic.\n\nWhy crypto futures? Honestly, mainly because shorting is straightforward, making it easier to act quickly on signals.\n\nHere's a debut signal I put out yesterday—check it out if you're curious: [https://henryzhang.substack.com/p/btc-crypto-futures-trading-signal](https://henryzhang.substack.com/p/btc-crypto-futures-trading-signal)\n\nIt accurately called a short on Bitcoin with exact entry, stop-loss, and take-profit points. I took the trade, and it turned out nicely. Of course, it's still early days, and whether there's consistent alpha here will take more testing and validation. Just thought I'd share what I'm up to and maybe get your thoughts!\n\nCheers!\n\n1. sell $BTC at 83486.5Algo TraderAPP *—* Yesterday at 5:12 PM \n2. sell $ETH at 1806.5Algo TraderAPP *—* Yesterday at 5:19 PM \n3. sell $BTC at 83466.7Algo TraderAPP *—* Yesterday at 9:53 PM \n4.

    "selftext": "Looks like a found out a project for earning more Higher than some Tradiotional stakings   \nWhat got me excited about Babylon is how it’s trying to use Bitcoin’s security to power up decentralized networks. Think of it like this: Bitcoin’s sitting there, being all secure and untouchable, and Babylon’s like, “Hey, why not let that security juice flow into Web3?” It connects us BTC holders to protocols that need liquidity or validation, and honestly, it’s a pretty slick idea. Scalable staking with Bitcoin? Sign me up for it.\n\nNow, here’s where my personal experience comes in. I’ve been using Bitget Wallet for a while—it’s just a solid, no-nonsense wallet for managing my stuff. Back on May 6, 2024, I noticed they rolled out support for Babylon’s staking features. I’m not gonna lie, I was stoked. It made everything so easy managing tokens, transferring assets, even poking around Babylon’s DApps. They even hooked up the Babylon Testnet, so I could mess around with staking on the test network without sweating my real BTC. \n\nIt was seamless, and I felt like a kid playing with a new toy. Fast forward to last month, and Bitget dropped this pre-staking promo for Babylon’s $BABY mainnet. I’m a Savings user on their platform, so I got in on it. From March 17 to April 17, you could convert BTC in Savings to this thing called BGBTC basically a way to pre-stake and earn a 4% APR plus some $BABY token airdrops. I jumped in because, why not? Extra earnings and a chance to get in early on Babylon’s ecosystem? That’s my kind of deal. \n\nIt’s not life-changing money or anything, but it’s a nice little bonus for something I was already interested in. One thing I’ve noticed about Bitget is they’re pretty good at sniffing out solid projects early. Their pre-market stuff always has these high-quality tokens, and I’ve made some decent moves jumping in before the hype hits. \n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/babylon/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/babylon/)",

    "title": "How to design a Proof of Work protocol that isn't an Energy-spending Maximizer",
    "selftext": "Similar to how the proverbial paperclip-maximizer will eventually reconstruct all planetary matter into paperclips, Nakamoto Consensus/longest-chain is a highly-inefficient family of Proof of Work (PoW) consensus protocols that maximize energy-usage. They will stop only once the total cost of production equals the total block reward (i.e. when marginal profit == 0)\n\nHowever, not all PoW protocols are as maximally energy-inefficient as Nakamoto Consensus. Some PoW protocols reduce waste and redundancy from uncle and orphaned blocks by reusing normally-discarded blocks.\n\n**TL;DR**:\n\n* **PoW Longest-chain**: Makes blocks expensive to produce with constant difficulty adjustments. All effort is discarded/wasted except for blocks produced in the longest-chain. Has weak economic security incentives. Weak to 51% attacks.\n* **PoW DAG**: Makes blocks cheap to produce. Accepts all valid blocks without discarding. Has moderate economic security incentives, but weak spam-protection. Strong against safety-type 51% attacks, but weak against liveness attacks.\n* **PoW GHOSTDAG**: Makes blocks cheap to produce. Accepts nearly all valid transactions. Has moderately-strong economic security incentives. Strong against safety-type 51% attacks, and moderately-strong against liveness attacks.\n* **PoS DAG**: Makes blocks cheap to produce. Accepts all valid blocks without discarding. Has strong economic security for both safety and liveness.\n\n-------------------------------\n\n**Longest-chain is an Energy-spending maximizer**\n\nBitcoin's longest-chain/heaviest-weight is a family of consensus protocols that maximizes energy-spending (and e-waste production) until the marginal profit reaches zero. It will stop only when the cost of production exceeds the security budget from its block rewards.\n\nEven as mining rigs become more efficient at producing SHA256 hashes (CPU -&gt; GPU -&gt; ASIC -&gt; faster ASIC), the never-ending difficulty adjustments completely nullify that efficiency increase.\n\nThere is major miner misalignment of economic incentive under longest-chain because those providing security (miners) do not have the same goals as those receiving the security (holders).\n\n**Is it possible to design a PoW protocol that is less wasteful?**\n\nThe main problem with longest-chain is that it wastes computations. Everyone is trying to build a block, but everyone's efforts get thrown out while only the winner's block is accepted. One way to decrease wastefulness is to not discard effort. There is a way to use discarded blocks under which is to use other consensus protocols like DAGs and GHOSTDAG.\n\n**What is a DAG, and why is it more efficient and more secure?**\n\nA DAG is another category of Distributed Ledger Technologies (blockchains are also DLTs), that has a mesh-like structure instead of a linear chain of blocks (e.g. blockchain). All valid blocks are accepted, and none are thrown away unless they're invalid or have bad signatures. Thus nothing gets wasted. Blocks are connected to each other like a mesh and ordered based on time-equivalents. Nano and the original IOTA (it later upgraded to PoS) are both PoW DAGs, and they're both extremely efficient.\n\nComputations are not wasted, and there doesn't need to be a constant difficulty adjustment. Blocks are constantly being produced at low cost (sub-pennies) and high throughput (thousands of TPS).\n\nIn addition, longest-chain protocol is weak to 51% attacks, especially when block production is slow and there is a pool of transactions waiting to be added (a mempool). When block production is fast and the pool is usually empty, reorg and censorship attacks from 51% attacks become largely irrelevant. Sure, blocks can be reorged or censored, but the throughput is so high that transactions get added anyways by other miners seconds after the attack. So the attack only affects other miner's block rewards, which are mostly insignificant anyways. This nearly nullifies the effectiveness of 51% attacks.\n\nTechnically, there is no mining for adding transactions. The mining is mainly for spam-prevention, which is an issue I will cover later.\n\n**What is the GHOSTDAG consensus protocol?**\n\nGHOSTDAG is a portmanteau of GHOST (Greedy Heaviest Observed SubTree, Ethereum's original PoW protocol) and DAG.\n\nLongest-chain protocol throws away blocks that are not in the longest-chain. Those discarded blocks are called uncle or orphaned blocks. GHOST uses uncle and orphaned blocks as part of the weight calculations for determining the heaviest-chain, which makes it more secure and efficient than vanilla longest-chain.\n\nGHOSTDAG goes a step further than GHOST. There are 2 versions of this. One version includes orphaned blocks into the chain in a pseudo-DAG-like manner. The other option discards the blocks, but includes the transactions from those discarded blocks as long as they're valid. Either way, computations are not being wasted. They have the same benefits as a DAG.\n\nUnlike with Nano's version of a DAG, GHOSTDAG (Kaspa's previous consensus protocol) has actual mining, which is mainly used for both spam-prevention and for security.\n\n**What's the downside with DAGs?**\n\nThere's always a tradeoff. For DAGs with high throughput, it's spam.\n\nLongest-chain's ultimate goal is to maximize energy-spending (and e-waste production) until the block reward is expended. DAG's goal is to maximize block production until transaction demand is fully-met.\n\nDAGs are so fast and efficient at producing blocks that they can become extremely spammy and sometimes have issues with liveness.\n\nNano had this problem because it went to the extreme of having no fees. Everyone was a miner, and everyone was constantly producing blocks. This leads to storage bloat and increased node/RPC hardware requirements. Mining was practically costless, but full nodes were not being compensated for storing the full ledger, and ledgers can grow very quickly when throughput is high.\n\nThus DAGs need some kind of process to reduce spam. Nano adds a small Proof of Work mechanism to combat spam, but they probably didn't go far enough. Nodes/RPCs are still not being compensated, and they're partially responsible for security. GHOSTDAG improves on this by requiring miners and a transaction fee paid to miners. This lessens the burden for security on uncompensated nodes and shifts it to the miners.\n\nSo it's possible to produce a partially secure, safe, and efficient PoW by using DAGs or GHOSTDAGs. There is still some minor/miner misalignment of economic incentive because under PoW, those providing security do not have the same economic incentives as those receiving security.\n\n**PoS DAGs**\n\nGoing one step further ...\n\nA PoS DAG protocol is even more secure. On top of all the benefits of DAGs, now validators are economically-compensated for providing security, and they have economic incentive to provide security, so the interest of those providing security and those receiving security are aligned.",

The tokens accrue yields automatically via the Babylon protocol, giving a way to use Bitcoin without having to relinquish ownership.\n\nRight now, the pre-deposit phase for $PUMPBTC is live, meaning early participants can start staking. Bitg3t is also running a zero gas fee deposit event, making it easier to get involved without extra transaction costs.\n\nIt’s an interesting shift—Bitcoin moving beyond just holding and into active participation in DeFi.

    "selftext": "This post isn’t about if a US bear market is about to happen or not. It’s how you think bitcoin would perform IF indeed a US bear market did happen now.\n\nBitcoin has been pretty correlated with the US market over the past 5 months since its post election bump. Over the past 7 weeks since s and p high Feb 19 bitcoin has dropped 13% and been unable to rise back anywhere near its Feb 19 value same as the market struggling to regain its peak. As opposed to gold price which has continued rising.\n\nLooking back at 2022 bear market I see that was a brutal year for bitcoin.\n\nI’m a big bitcoin believer and have a good chuck of my brokerage in IBIT. I’ve been waiting for bitcoin to show it can diverge from the US market like gold but I haven’t seen any evidence of it. And now I have some concern how low it could go and how long it may stay depressed if we are entering a bear market.\n\nI forget exact data but I think around 15-25% of bitcoin is held by US/canadian investors. So vast majority is global investors. That gives me some hope it can diverge. But the positive news of US institutional adoption may be mitigated by US economy crashing, and EU and other key countries haven’t seemed to show much adoption of it yet, right?\n\nI think it’s 50-50 on which way it moves next 6 months if US is indeed entering a bear market. Would love to get other’s thoughts or points I’m overlooking.",

This really can add up.\n\nAssuming a bitcoin transaction takes 250 bytes of data and there are 20,000 full nodes. Each transaction takes up 5MB total. That’s a lot for one transaction! 5MB on AWS S3 costs 1/100 of a cent (USD) per month. Assuming bitcoin remains for 100 years, the transaction cost could be as high as $0.12. This is ignoring the fact that the number of nodes could grow and that there are other costs as well (eg electricity). All blockchains that attempt to have full nodes (eg ethereum cardano) have this problem.\n\nTo be fair, all nodes in a server farm could all share one record of the blockchain so it’s hard to say how many copies of the blockchain there truly are.\n\n\nJust one of many reasons why I don’t believe in crypto.

    "selftext": "Anybody who has ever invested in crypto will understand the dilemma when you lock up your funds to receive rewards but cut yourself off from them when you need liquidity the most. It's a tough decision, especially in a bearish market. Bedrock is staking differently. Rather than making users decide between liquidity and rewards, it enables Bitcoin, Ethereum and IoTeX holders to restake their holdings without forfeiting liquidity. Through integrations such as EigenLayer and Babylon, it is approaching optimizing staking to be more efficient without compromising accessibility.\n\nInterest in Bedrock has been strong, its Binance Wallet IDO was 9,653% over subscribed and brought in $123.2 million, an indication that a majority of people buy into the potential of this strategy. An early listing on Biitget provided traders with first-mover advantage and the platform is currently hosting a PoolX airdrop event providing its users with another opportunity to engage with the project.\n\nAs the attention continues to grow around scalability, security, and real-world usability, it will be exciting to witness how liquid restaking develops. Is this the future of staking in DeFi?\n\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bedrock-dao/",

    "selftext": " I’ve been noticing a growing wave of projects popping up around liquid staking and restaking, and I’m wondering if it’s just me picking up on this trend or if it’s something broader. It feels like these types of projects are gaining momentum, and I can see why they’d attract interest.   \n  \nBitcoin, for instance, doesn’t offer any yield on its own, and traditional staking often comes with pretty rigid limitations low rewards, locked-up funds, that sort of thing. So, it makes sense that people are drawn to solutions like liquid staking and restaking, which promise more flexibility and potentially better returns.What’s got me curious, though, is whether the tokens tied to these projects are actually worth investing in.   \n  \nThey seem to generate a ton of buzz and visibility, which is hard to ignore. Take established names like LIDO and AAVE, for example they’ve carved out a solid presence in the space. Then there’s newer players like Babylon, and even unlisted projects like PumpBTC, which are already making waves and getting people talking before they’ve even hit the market. That kind of hype can be a double-edged sword: it’s exciting, but it also makes me wonder if it’s all just noise or if there’s real value there.   \n  \nSo, with everyone out there hunting for the next big crypto gem, I’m trying to figure out if this liquid staking and restaking niche is worth a closer look especially the fresh, up-and-coming projects. Do you think these could be a smart bet for investors, or is the attention they’re getting just a flash in the pan? I’d love to hear your take on whether this trend has legs and if these tokens could deliver as solid investment opportunities.\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/community/search/top/pumpbtc/](https://coinmarketcap.com/community/search/top/pumpbtc/)",

If broken, we can expect a strong impulse move, which I’ve been waiting for all this time. Those stops are still untouched.\n\n⚡ Futures Market &amp; Potential Short Squeeze\n\n\t•\tOpen Interest at $84,250: More than 5,000 BTC held in positions.\n\t•\tKey Liquidity Cluster still above $85,000 → a possible short squeeze scenario.\n\t•\tBalance is shifting towards limit buyers in the $83,600 – $84,000 range.\n\t•\t$84,800 has a large number of sell orders, but market participants may pull them at any moment.\n\n📈 Summary:\n\n✅ $83,600 – $84,000 → Strong Buy Zone (institutional accumulation).\n\n✅ $84,800 – $85,500 → Sell Zone, where liquidity may be collected before a move higher.\n\n✅ $86,500 – $88,000 → Liquidity grab zone, where stops could trigger a squeeze and push us even higher.\n\n📌 As always, manage your risk. Bitcoin remains bullish as long as we trade within this range. Only major news could push us out of this accumulation channel. If we hold this momentum, institutions will likely shift their accumulation zone higher from the current range.\n\n🚀 Stay sharp, the move is coming!",

    "selftext": "\nGood morning, friends! Hope you’re enjoying your coffee because today’s Bitcoin price action has been nothing short of intense. Let’s break it down.\n\n📉 What Just Happened?\n\t•\tA sudden drop in BTC price was triggered by a market sell-off of ~900 BTC.\n\n\t•\tThe order book reacted instantly, with major buy support at $85,000 absorbing the sell-off.\n\n\t•\tCurrently, $85,000 has the largest buy wall (~1,500 BTC), and it’s constantly refreshing – likely managed by algo traders and fundamental buyers.\n\n📊 Key Order Book Zones &amp; Market Trend\n\n🔹 Support at $85,000 – strong defense level, keeping BTC in a new range of $85,000 – $86,000.\n\n🔹 Sell wall at $86,000 – this could slow any immediate upside move, leading to further accumulation.\n\n🔹 Liquidity target at $89,000 – yesterday, we failed to reach it, but it remains a key target. BTC might push higher to sweep this level.\n\n📈 Trend &amp; Market Outlook\n\n\t•\tBitcoin remains bullish despite this shakeout.\n\t•\tThe price action is still inside an ascending channel, meaning the broader trend has not broken.\n\t•\tSharp liquidations like today are normal in an uptrend, as they are often orchestrated by market makers before the next move up.\n\n🚀 Conclusion: The Uptrend is Intact!\n\n🔸 BTC is still bullish.\n\n🔸 Watch $85K support and $86K resistance – a break above could push us towards $89K.\n\n🔸 Trade smart, stay patient, and let liquidity guide the way.\n\n💰 Wishing you all a profitable day – stay disciplined, and good luck! 🚀",

    "title": "Bitcoin's security budget has declined 40% over the past 4 years - Fixing Bitcoin's long-term security problem",
    "selftext": "####**The elephant in the room: Bitcoin's declining security budget**\n\nLike all Proof of Work (PoW) networks, Bitcoin is mostly secure from 51% attack (majority attacks) as long as its security budget remains high relative to the total value protected. There have been plenty of PoW blockchains with smaller security budgets that have been ruined by 51% attacks, which led to large reorgs or double-spends. Historically, Bitcoin's security budget has increased between each cycle, but this increase has been decreasing from the start, and has now reached an inflection point. Transaction fees on average still only cover 1% of the block reward and are completely insufficient to cover for Bitcoin's security.\n\nAs of March 2025, Bitcoin security budget, when CPI-adjusted, has **declined over 45%** in real value compared to 4 years ago (sources: \"Miners Revenue\" from Blockchain.com, CPI data from St. Louis FRED).\n\nThere is a well-studied, recent research paper covering this long-term systemic risk to Bitcoin:\n\n**\"The Imminent (and Avoidable) Security Risk of Bitcoin Halving\"** - https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4801113\n\t\nThis research paper from Apr 2024 analyzes the long-term effects of Bitcoin halvings on Bitcoin's security budget and Bitcoin's security.\n\nDue to the halvings, Bitcoin's security relative to the amount being protected (aka the \"security budget ratio\") roughly halves every 4 years. Transactions fees have not been rising enough to make up for the loss in block subsidy. In fact, transaction fees on average still only cover 1% of the total block subsidy. The Cost of Attack (CoA) on Bitcoin is expected to continue declining in the long run.\n\n####**The researchers identify many major long-term issues for Bitcoin's security model**:\n\n* **Misaligned security incentives**: Bitcoin miners are profit-driven. Unlike with PoS, Bitcoin miners do not have strong economic incentive to protect Bitcoin when mining is no longer profitable. There is economic loss in protecting Bitcoin against a strong 51% attacker.\n* **Declining security budget ratio**: The \"widening divergence between the decreasing security budget and the rising total value of Bitcoin has been identified as a substantial long-term security problem\".\n* **Price instabilities**: \"can push mining activity far below its equilibrium value\" where \"the hash rate required by a 51% attacker is substantially reduced\"\n* **Secondary markets from unprofitable mining**: \"In our default scenario, the 28% of miners that become unprofitable in post-halving equilibrium may be willing to sell their hardware. Then an attacker who aims to acquire 50% of the total hash rate could buy this cheap hardware.\"\n* **Cost of Attack**: Was previously expected to be $5-20B in mining equipment, but possibly much cheaper due to secondary markets. Ongoing cost is $100M/day cost for maintaining a 51% attack.\n* **Timing attacks**: Due to difficulty adjustments around halvings, the total hash rates can be up to three times lower than before the halving, making Bitcoin 3x easier to 51% attack.\n* **Insufficient Transaction Fees**: Transaction fees on average have not risen at all, and are too low to cover for the loss in block subsidy from halvings\n* **Goldfinger attacks**: \"Stakeholders with intentions to undermine Bitcoin or profit from short positions may actively engage in Goldfinger attacks\"\n\nNote that the researchers based their figures on S9 ASIC miners since those are readily available on secondary markets. The CoA using newer S19 and S21 miners should be even cheaper by up to 3x because they are much more efficient.\n\n####**Possible solutions**\n\nThe authors recommend several solutions, all of which require controversial hard forks.\n\n* Removing supply cap and having permanent block subsidy issuance\n* Imposing minimum mandatory transaction fees\n* Switching to other more secure consensus protocols (like PoS)\n* Using a gradual inflation-reduction curve to eliminate sudden shocks in mining drops from halvings\n* Implementing a smaller max difficulty-adjustment\n\nTheir primary recommendation is to remove the supply cap and allow for permanent sustainable block subsidy issuance. It is questionable whether the Bitcoin community will accept many of these proposals.",

Yesterday, we cleared the strong seller wall at $84,500, meaning this resistance no longer exists.\n\nNow, we can see that institutional buyers have set up strong buy walls over the weekend, indicating a potential accumulation phase before the next move.\n\n⸻\n\n📉 Order Book &amp; Key Liquidity Zones\n\n🔹 Support Zones (Buy Orders):\n\n✅ $83,000 – $83,200 → ~700 BTC in buy orders\n\n✅ $82,500 – $82,800 → ~1,000 BTC in buy orders\n\n✅ $81,500 – $81,800 → ~1,500 BTC in buy orders (largest buy wall)\n\n💡 These are likely set by institutional players, not retail traders’ limit orders.\n\n🔹 Resistance Zones (Sell Orders):\n\n🚩 $87,500 → Massive sell wall with ~1,500 BTC\n\n🚩 $88,000 → More than 1,000 BTC in short stop-loss orders\n\n📌 Potential scenario:\n\nIf Bitcoin bounces from strong support zones, it will likely squeeze liquidity from short sellers at $87,000+ and possibly spike through $88,000 to clear stop losses.\n\n⸻\n\n📊 Trading Plan for Today\n\n🎯 Strategy:\n\n\t•\tEntering a short-term long from $83,500 – $82,500\n\t•\tTargeting $87,000 – $88,000\n\t•\tExiting with a limit order, since a wick and sharp retracement are likely in that range\n\n💡 Be cautious: Institutional players have set a “trap” around Bitcoin, holding it in their controlled liquidity zones. Weekends are highly manipulative—either range-bound or suddenly spiking up/down to liquidate both sides.\n\n⸻\n\n📢 Final Thoughts\n\nIn my opinion, Bitcoin remains bullish for now. However, expect potential market manipulation over the weekend.\n\nWishing everyone a great day, solid profits, and a strong cup of coffee! ☕🚀\nAnd remember—never stop believing in Bitcoin and financial independence! 💪🔥\n\nhttps://ru.tradingview.com/chart/1CneWjKu/",

    "selftext": "\nBitcoin continues to move within a medium-term uptrend. We still haven’t reached a proper retest of the lower channel boundary or the trendline.\n\n📊 RSI is sitting at 44, which is a neutral zone, meaning there is no clear directional bias yet. Bitcoin’s price is still being tested against macroeconomic conditions and political factors.\n\n⸻\n\n📉 Order Book &amp; Liquidity Zones:\n\n🔹 Key Support Zones:\n\n✅ $81,800 – $82,000 → Strong buy-side liquidity with over 1,200 BTC in limit orders\n\n✅ $80,500 → Large buy interest with significant limit orders\n\n🔹 Key Resistance Zones:\n\n🚩 $83,200 – $83,500 → ~850 BTC in sell orders\n\n🚩 $84,500 → A major sell wall with ~1,100 BTC\n\n🚩 $87,000 → Massive resistance with ~1,500 BTC in limit sell orders\n\n⸻\n\n🔥 Summary &amp; Key Levels to Watch:\n\n\t•\t$82,000 is confirmed as strong support, while $84,500 remains the key barrier for upside movement.\n\n\t•\tIf BTC breaks above $84,500, this will confirm an uptrend continuation, likely triggering a spike straight to $87,000.\n\n\t•\tIf BTC breaks below $81,800, we could see a retest of the lower trendline around $76,000 (though this scenario seems less likely for now).\n\n⸻\n\n🎯 Trading Strategy for Today:\n\n📌 If you’re looking for entry zones:\n\n\t•\tFor long-term accumulation: $80,500 – $81,000 looks like the best area to catch a bounce.\n\n\t•\tFor short-term speculation: A breakout above $84,500 could lead to a rapid push toward $87,000.\n\nI’ll be closely monitoring the order book and news flow—if anything changes, I’ll provide timely updates.\n\n💪 Stay strong, we are in this together!

From my research that placed btc at 76,500k , so yes we are in a stage of correction. And possibly the biggest market crash since covid comming. You can believe what you want and have your own oppinions,  but there has been many major influences in the stock market and crypto communities talking about this biggest crash for sometime. As with the covid crash everything will pick back up. This could continue for the next 8 to 12 months. So just stick it out and wait ✋️.  ",

    "selftext": "For those who’ve been mining Pi on their phones since the early days (shoutout to my fellow Pioneers!), this feels like a long-overdue validation. Pi Network launched back on March 14, 2019—Pi Day, naturally—founded by Stanford PhDs Nicolas Kokkalis and Chengdiao Fan with a mission to make crypto accessible to everyday people.   \n  \nUnlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, which require hefty hardware or technical know-how, Pi let us mine from our phones with a single tap a day. Skeptics called it a gimmick, but here we are, six years later, with over 35 million users and now a top-11 spot on CoinMarketCap.\n\n  \nThe crypto space is full of doubters, and Pi’s had its share of FUD over the years. “It’s a scam!” “It’ll crash when everyone dumps!” “Where’s the value if it’s free to mine?” I get it anything that grows this fast without a traditional playbook raises eyebrows. Pre-mainnet, some analysts predicted PI could tank to $11 or lower if sell pressure outweighed demand.   \n  \nOthers, like Telegaon, threw out wild bullish calls like $107 in 2025. The truth? No one knows yet. Crypto’s volatile, and Pi’s still finding its footing. Price predictions are all over the map. CoinCodex says $5.82 by year-end, maybe $6.80 by 2030. Others see it hitting $100+ if the hype train keeps rolling. Me? I’m cautiously optimistic. If Pi can deliver on its peer-to-peer marketplace vision and avoid the pitfalls of overhype, it’s got a shot at staying top-tier. for now i'm focosing on the BItget event to deposit to get free 12 $PI \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tunkwshd8pme1.png?width=360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c51b936242d0fddac485fe6c0dd0deb05594b90\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pi/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pi/)",

Exchanges get to buy crypto for the best prices possible, and they want to make you feel as much despair as possible.\n\nTo the point where you are thinking that it is over, bull run has ended, there will be no alt season.\n\n[\\\\\"No Alt SZN\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/b08amia02nme1.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0575bfb8dc71d9230c01dcae74d4a420d3af2e9d)\n\nWell, the same thing has happened over and over again.

It is designed to shake out retail from positions, to make you feel scared or like you made a mistake. As can be seen above, we are simply in a massive bear trap. We still have so much of the bull remaining, and all metrics point towards the rest of the year being massive.\n\n**Golden Opportunity**\n\nThe truth is that right now is actually the point where future millionaires are made. \n\nAs Warren Buffet puts it \"Be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful\"\n\nWell that exactly rings true during this fearful market. We are so close to alt season now and with everything on fire sales it is the time to load up on strong conviction plays.\n\n**Kendu**\n\nHeading into 2025 alt season, one play that consistently stands out to me is Kendu.\n\nThe community has grown for over a year now, building with it an establishment and foundation that is essentially unseen elsewhere.\n\n[Certik Audit](https://preview.redd.it/r7n1aj173nme1.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73162970f853b336e2ccca92a9c24f0e0c006ca5)\n\nThe most notable achievement to me is the Certik rating. A massive stamp of approval and actually the 18th \"safest\" meme in the world. Further, it has a community rating equal to Shibs and higher then Pepes. That is not to mention that the audit was achieved through voting 50k times, the second time to ever be completed by a memecoin community, a testament to the communities strength.\n\nNext is the massive IRL movement that is brewing. I just simply have never come across anything like it.\n\n[Miami Music Week](https://preview.redd.it/lstp9thk3nme1.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08a95b72ebaa013f5f07a9cc1e1279fed753358f)\n\nJust as one example, a Shib OG is sponsoring Miami Music week this year. Kendu will be there as a sponsor for 3 days. In that time:\n\n* Merchandise being handed out\n* Thousands of Kendu Energy drinks being handed out\n* A Kendu Stall\n* Custom cocktails and Kendu Energy being used as the main drink mixer behind the bar\n* Being mentioned on radio to hundreds of thousands of listeners\n* Thousands of attendees, including but not limited to literal Olympians\n\nThis is all through the effort of one community member. Now extend that to other community members pushing the name in USA, India, England, Switzerland, Australia and everywhere in between.\n\nThis is a global movement that is simply not replicated anywhere else.\n\nThat to me is why I have chosen Kendu as my conviction play. You cant fake IRL and it is simply the best way to build recognition.\n\nThis community has demonstrated its sincere tenacity in order for success during this market downturn and its own consolidation period. A community that has not faltered for over a year now.\n\nIt is simply a matter of time and if you were ever looking for a good entry, now is quite likely the best time ever in the lifetime of Kendu. Floored out, beginning to form higher lows and higher highs, building even during this horrible market.\n\nTell me, what do you think will happen to strong communities when the market finally flips? Kendu is in absolute prime position for that.\n\nNow is the time to establish yourself in conviction plays and Kendu is a pretty damn good candidate.\n\nJoin us, join the movement. We await you.\n\nr/KenduInu_Ecosystem \n\nETH CA: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18  \nSOL CA: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45  \nBASE CA: 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7  \n  \nCG: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu)  \nCMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)",

    "selftext": "Pi Network, a decentralized cryptocurrency project, allows users to mine Pi coins directly from their smartphones, overcoming the energy-intensive barriers of traditional mining. The network categorizes its users into four roles: Pioneer, Contributor, Ambassador, and Node, each contributing to the growth and security of the platform.\n\nAs Pi Network gains traction, there's an exciting opportunity for traders looking to capitalize on price differences across exchanges. Currently, Pi coins are listed on several prominent exchanges like OKX, Bitget, Gate Mexc, etc. but if you're looking for the best deals, Bitget stands out as the top choice. On Bitget, you can find a total giveaway of 413,200 USDT, making it an excellent opportunity for those considering arbitrage trading.\n\nIn comparison, OKX offers no giveaway for Pi coins, and Gate.io has a giveaway of 30,000 USDT (or 0.2 BTC), which is significantly lower than Bitget's offer. For traders seeking to maximize their profits with Pi Network's coins, Bitget offers the best value and potential for arbitrage opportunities.\n\nWith the growing popularity of Pi Network, these exchanges are important players in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, so if you're looking to buy Pi coins, now might be the right time to take advantage of the favourable rates on different exchanges.\n\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pi/",

However, after diving deeper into macroeconomics, I believe Bitcoin’s price is heavily influenced by broader economic trends. In the next 6–12 months, I expect economic conditions to deteriorate, with the Fed’s response—especially to inflation and labor market data—determining whether we enter a bull or bear market.\n\nThat said, I have two reasons for not selling my Bitcoin:\n\n\t1.\tA potential federal Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) announcement under a Trump administration, which could drive prices up.\n\t2.\tIf inflation stays below 3%, tightening liquidity may push the Fed to ease QT, supporting asset prices.\n\nGiven this outlook, would it make sense to hedge with S&amp;P 500 put options expiring in Q4 2025, or would that be too risky?

I don't care about Governments' Bitcoin policies nor politics:** You're a TA-only type of trader that believes news and what governments do doesn't move markets. You don't want to see any discussion about government policies, laws, politicians, or politics in the Daily Threads. Charts, lines, and astrology for men ONLY!\n4. **I love politics and debating about it with anyone and everyone!** You are obsessed with politics. You spend your days on r/politics and wish every subreddit was a place where you could debate politics and argue about politicians all day long.\n5. **Something Else (that I posted below):** You have a different idea of how the mods should approach political discussion that you have posted below as a reply.\n\nThis poll will close in 7 days.\n\nDisclaimer: There is absolutely zero guarantee the results of this poll will influence any moderator decisions, I'm mainly curious what YOU want to see in the Daily Threads. **As always, all subreddit rules apply, especially rules #1 and #2.** Keep hitting the report button for any content that violates any rules in the sidebar.\n\n[If you use Old Reddit, click here to temporarily switch to New Reddit to vote](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1ivow3j)\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1ivow3j)",

    "title": "Biggest security issue with iOS hot wallets?",
    "selftext": "Seems that no one really brings this one up, but isn't the biggest attack vector the fact that there is a person / team that is able to release updates for these hot wallets? Obviously, at the end of it, even though the source code is available on GitHub  and open source, that doesn't matter one bit, as someone is still taking this code and running the build scripts and then publishing the new version to the app store.\n\nThere is nothing stopping said individual from making some uncommitted changes locally before building and releasing a new version of the app (so not visible publicly on GitHub, etc.). These changes could purposefully introduce any number of malicious behaviours into the app, such as 1) deterministic private key generation for new wallets or 2) an inconspicuous private key logging mechanism or 3) have all transaction signing simply send to addresses that this individual owns. Effectively draining users' funds until people realize and the app gets rolled back or taken down. Even an hour of time with a malicious version out there is enough to cause significant financial loss.\n\nThis is my biggest fear with hot wallets. The more popular they get, and the more people are using them to store a large amount of bitcoin, cumulatively, the more tempting this becomes to the individual with the ability to roll out app updates. It just needs to get into the wrong hands.\n\nSome ways in which this could be mitigated:\n\n1. If Apple would allow users to disable automatic updates only for certain individual apps (such as hot wallets for example), and if they would allow checksum verifications with source code in some way, then the user could update to a new version on their own once they verify and audit the code themselves, or allow time to pass for others in the community to do so, etc.\n2. If I somehow knew that Apple placed an extreme level of scrutiny for certain app updates, such as hot wallets, then this would at least be something.. But I truly have no idea if they apply any more rigor when reviewing actual code changes of hot wallets vs some random game.\n\nOr perhaps I am missing something and this is well protected against? If someone can tell me why I should not be worried about this apparent flaw in the release cycle of hot wallet code, please enlighten me. As I do think absent of this particular problem, hot wallets can actually be very secure.",

CLSK supports untapped energy assets in rural America. Flexibility to power off builds relationships with communities. Current strategy will be to expand outside of Georgia to reduce concentration risk from weather changes.\n\n• All mining facilities and rigs are owned entirely by CLSK (increases margins over time). CLSK market share and revenue grow as competitors FOMO into HPC-AI.\n\n• CFO Gary Vecchiarelli said they are open to the idea of returning capital to shareholders via additional share buybacks in the future (likely after expansion goals met).\n\n• $2.8B assets while CLSK market cap is $2.9B. Margins increased per kWh and cost per BTC is down.\n\n• With altcoins in the mud, the best beta play on BTC will likely be CLSK. When it goes up, it might go up quick. Not financial advice. DYOR.",

    "title": "\"This time is different\"",
    "selftext": "[Link to original post I made almost 8 years ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/5vdiv3/longterm_pattern/)\n\nSince mid-2014, I've maintained a personal chart for Bitcoin's historical price.  Even at that time, it was interesting to me to see similar trends in stability followed by quick jumps in price.  Perhaps this is Elliott Wave behavior?\n\n[Anyway, I thought I'd share the updated chart](https://imgur.com/a/wduAnox)\n\nThe blue line is the price history.  For the red line, it's a rough trace of the first box.  For the third and subsequent boxes, it's about 60% residual height to show some decay over time.  Today, you see quite a bit of this stuff with explanations related to halving cycles, so perhaps this doesn't need too much explanation for people these days.\n\nMy point for posting today, is that so many people are caught up with recent news as it relates to Bitcoin.  People have almost always tried to create a narrative around WHY Bitcoin is moving up or down in recent days.  Yes, current events and the actions of larger participants in the ecosystem will have some impact on the charts (MtGox, FTX, US SBR).  And those impacts will cause deviations in the pattern.  But the larger picture is the *almost* inevitable march forward on the curve.  ZOOM OUT!  If SBR happens soon, maybe we get a peak this year.  If not, maybe Apple or a large group of companies start the next stage rolling.  Either way or any other way, it still appears to be fairly early in this cycle.\n\nFor those interested, [link to my thoughts on why this behavior exists](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/7zhhky/update_on_longterm_pattern/duoc0vp/)\n\nAs the sidebar says, this isn't trading advice.  However, most TA is understanding that large populations of people can be \"simulated\" with mathematical models and then finding the one that best fits the data.",

If not, welcome to the play of this cycle.\n\nEarly in the days of BTC Satoshi Nakamoto declared \"It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on. If enough people think the same way, that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.\"\n\nFast forward to now, we have countries creating national reserves of BTC and worldwide adoption occurring.\n\nBecause people believed.\n\n**Community**\n\n\"What matters is that we are united in the core of the vision, being Shiba as the pure actualisation of a decentralised and perpetual community\" - Ryoshi\n\nSince the inception of BTC and the demonstration of how belief breeds success, countless examples have been witnessed, with the most notable being Shiba.\n\nThe above Ryoshi quote demonstrating the ethos of uniting a community in a common goal and allowing that belief to catch on.\n\nWe liken the conviction and \"maxi\" attitude as the factors to allow these ideas to blossom.\n\nSat now in 2025 with an imminently approaching alt season and the largest bull run ever (when eth decides to do something...) there lay so much opportunity ahead.\n\nNamely, in strong conviction plays that align with the early ethos of Shiba and BTC.\n\n**Kendu**\n\n[A movement](https://reddit.com/link/1ii7eoq/video/36m625egxahe1/player)\n\nIf you have seen Kendu on this sub or in the past and faded, I invite you to reconsider.\n\nWatch the above video and know that Kendu is one that represents the same ethos as those early days of BTC and Shiba.\n\nOne that is dedicated to creating a perpetual and decentralised movement.\n\n**Just in case it catches on**\n\nAs MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor says \"If BTC isnt going to zero, then its going to a million\"\n\nwell the same can be likened to Kendu. We have grown every day since inception, are decentralised and not governed by any singular person, representing the core ethos of what Shiba did. Basically \"If Kendu isnt going to zero, then its going to billions\" and we have proven just this through our 11+ months of proof of life. We have proven so by our daily holder ATHs and continuous foundation development.\n\nIt's just the most insane organic social movement filled with unlimited talent and connections with everything it takes to capture serious market share this cycle. The Kendu attitude is infectious with the ferocious dog representing the unlimited tenacity of the community.\n\nThe core community all share the same vision, adding new people to the core beliefs day in and day out. A community that will never stop until it succeeds on a scale we all envision it to.  It's a matter of time and work, and we absolutely will not stop.\n\nThe truth is that many wish they got in on BTC or Shiba early before they flew. It is easy to say now well I definitely would have bought that if I could go back. Holding on to Shiba at 100k mcap or BTC at $10. But would you have during those early days?\n\nSo then, I ask you to look at the spiritual successor to Shiba. It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on. If enough people think the same way, that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\n\\-----\n\nETH CA: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18  \nSOL CA: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45\n\nCG: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu)  \nCMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)",

    "selftext": "Hello! I am currently taking a course regarding blockchain technology and my professor has us following along the Princeton Book on \"Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies\".\n\n[https://d28rh4a8wq0iu5.cloudfront.net/bitcointech/readings/princeton\\_bitcoin\\_book.pdf](https://d28rh4a8wq0iu5.cloudfront.net/bitcointech/readings/princeton_bitcoin_book.pdf)   (page 34-36)\n\nHere is a youtube video covering the very same material:\n\n[https://youtu.be/fOMVZXLjKYo?si=oTFDviBG\\_Pj51EJb&amp;t=1487](https://youtu.be/fOMVZXLjKYo?si=oTFDviBG_Pj51EJb&amp;t=1487)\n\nNow I am taking issue with the Merkle Tree explanation provided in this book. However to question material provided by Princeton would seem inconceivable. So I would like to ask this subreddit for clarification before I make a fool of myself in front of my professor. But I genuinely understand this book to be misrepresenting the merkle tree structure. I would APPRECIATE your feedback to my post and let me know what you think. Have I misunderstood something? Is the book making an error?\n\nOk, on to the material. Here is a direct quote from the book.\n\n&gt;Suppose we have a number of blocks containing data. These blocks comprise the leaves of our tree. We group these data blocks into pairs of two, and then for each pair, we build a data structure that has two hash pointers, one to each of these blocks. These data structures make the next level up of the tree. We in turn group these into groups of two, and for each pair, create a new data structure that contains the hash of each. We continue doing this until we reach a single block, the root of the tree.\n\nHere is a corresponding figure presenting a merkle tree structure from the book:\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/UnpEjqJ.png](https://i.imgur.com/UnpEjqJ.png)\n\nREBUTTAL:\n\nThe specific grievance is:\n\n&gt;we build a data structure that has two hash pointers, one to each of these blocks.\n\nI claim this is not the case(with sources provided later). I claim the data structure(parent node) that is made for each pair contains the hash of the concatenation of the children. So if there is a pair of leaves A and B, the parent node does NOT contain two hash pointers for each leaf which is written as H(A) H(B) in the book's diagram. Instead, it contains a single hash of both A and B concatenated, that is  denoted as H(A||B).\n\nFurther, there are no pointers which let you instantly hop from the parent to its children. The only way to find the child given a parent in practice is by using index arithmetic because all of the nodes in a binary tree can be denoted using indexing. And indexing follows a structure that lets you navigate the tree.\n\nI claim the above misunderstanding leads to a further misunderstanding regarding a proof of membership. As I understand, a proof of membership is the same as a proof of inclusion and a merkle proof.\n\nHere is the text from the book:\n\n&gt;Proof of membership. Another nice feature of Merkle trees is that, unlike the block chain that we built before, it allows a concise proof of membership. Say that someone wants to prove that a certain data block is a member of the Merkle Tree. As usual, we remember just the root. Then they need to show us this data block, and the blocks on the path from the data block to the root. We can ignore the rest of the tree, as the blocks on this path are enough to allow us to verify the hashes all the way up to the root of the tree. See Figure 1.8 for a graphical depiction of how this works.\n\nHere is a diagram they provide:\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/A5KKDJO.png](https://i.imgur.com/A5KKDJO.png)\n\nREBUTTAL: Consider a trivial example of a merkle tree where it contains 3 nodes.  It has a root. The root has 2 children(leaf nodes in this case). Also assume a merkle tree is structured as I claim: The leaf nodes contain hashes of their corresponding datablocks. The parents of these leaf nodes contain the hash of the concatenated child hashes. And any further parents are recursively constructed in the same fashion.\n\nGiven this simple case, let the datablocks be denoted as A and B. Then one leaf node contains H(A) and the other contains H(B). The parent contains the hash H( H(A) || H(B) ).\n\nI want to prove the membership of the datablock A. The book claims I need only provide the direct path from root to leaf node of A. And I claim this is NOT enough information. Suppose I do as the book states and provide the root and the leaf node containing H(A). First providing the leaf node H(A) is actually redundant. Anyone can fabricate the correct hash of a datablock on the fly. What we really want is a piece of information that confirms H(A) is indeed part of this tree where the hashes propagate upward to the root - and where the root is combined authenticator for all the elements in the tree. Ok so maybe adding the root will provide enough information? If I observe the hash stored in the root which is the output of H(H(A)||H(B)). Well this is NOT helpful! How can I confirm that H(A) was propagated upwards into the root and passed into a hash with H(B) concatenated. I have H(A), but I'm missing half of the input so how can I possibly reproduce the output of H(H(A)||H(B)) to verify? The only way to verify would be if I was provided H(B).\n\nI claim the information that must be provided are the sibling nodes along the direct route from leaf to root which contradicts the claims in the book.\n\nSOURCES\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/hA7fAzL.png](https://i.imgur.com/hA7fAzL.png)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/a4d6Z3h.png](https://i.imgur.com/a4d6Z3h.png)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/CmDs8tg.png](https://i.imgur.com/CmDs8tg.png)\n\n[https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/\\~raluca/cs261-f15/readings/merkleodb.pdf](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~raluca/cs261-f15/readings/merkleodb.pdf)\n\n======================\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/Tj8XEex.png](https://i.imgur.com/Tj8XEex.png)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/TSrdJaA.png](https://i.imgur.com/TSrdJaA.png)\n\n[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.07941](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.07941)\n\n======================\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/cLiRDAe.png](https://i.imgur.com/cLiRDAe.png)  \n[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2096720922000343](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2096720922000343)\n\n======================\n\nThe section on k-ary merkle trees puts further emphasis on the sibling requirements because the number of siblings grows with k.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/KRFxhTC.png](https://i.imgur.com/KRFxhTC.png)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/JgQ3Pvu.png](https://i.imgur.com/JgQ3Pvu.png)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/o0sZmGV.png](https://i.imgur.com/o0sZmGV.png)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/YoRIfxw.png](https://i.imgur.com/YoRIfxw.png)\n\n[https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/materials/2018/Kuszmaul.pdf](https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/materials/2018/Kuszmaul.pdf)\n\n======================\n\nHere is a merkle tree implementation and the getProof method demonstrates the siblings are returned AND it uses index arithmetic to locate the siblings rather than a \"hash pointer\" as described in book.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/3Nm7Mjg.png](https://i.imgur.com/3Nm7Mjg.png)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/mqOpYFB.png](https://i.imgur.com/mqOpYFB.png)\n\n[https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/merkle-tree/blob/master/src/core.ts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/merkle-tree/blob/master/src/core.ts)\n\n======================\n\nThis is a response to a question about how the merkle proof works and they walk through the steps pretty clearly with an actual example using hashes.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/icda30h.png](https://i.imgur.com/icda30h.png)\n\n[https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/69018/merkle-root-and-merkle-proofs](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/69018/merkle-root-and-merkle-proofs)",

    "title": "CLSK is likely the most UNDERVALUED out of all BTC mining stocks",
    "selftext": "Links: [Figures 1 to 4](https://x.com/charlesalza/status/1884811658276520184) and [Figures 5 to 8](https://x.com/charlesalza/status/1884817385045066183)\n\nThis is a long post that describes why and how CLSK will end up with a higher projected % BTC holdings per market cap in June 2025 REGARDLESS if $BTC gets to $80k, $100k, $120k or $150k (Figure 1). These figures indicate buying CLSK now is worth MORE BTC later. It also means CLSK has MORE EFFICIENT mining operations that are misappropriately valued LESS than worse mining operations by RIOT and MARA. Details below:\n\nIf one can’t explain in a sentence what a company does, then it’s unlikely to be a good company. The way BTC miners make money is by acquiring BTC at lower than market value and either selling immediately (like IREN) or holding until BTC price goes up (like LSK). Personally, I do not like it when BTC miners change plans last minute. Unlike RIOT who just announced HPC-AI interest, IREN has a track record of high operational uptime (which is necessary for HPC-AI) and has provided HPC-AI services since 2019.\n\nIn a nutshell, both CLSK and IREN have higher operational uptime (Figure 2) and higher efficiency (Figure 3) than competitors RIOT and MARA. Consistently meeting quarterly goals demonstrates efficient growth by IREN and CLSK and exemplifies why these two businesses expand (gaining market share) while competitors (like RIOT and MARA) scramble to mimic others to attract investors.\n\nWhen it comes to companies holding BTC, CLSK may have more upside than others. Currently, most BTC miners have high percent shorts: CLSK (27.13%), MARA (24.12%), RIOT (19.91%), IREN (7.45%). As a rule of thumb, all shorts must eventually close positions which leads to more buy orders. BTC miners have been lagging BTC due in part to these high shorts and also by the end of year retail sell off brought on by the December federal reserve meeting. However, not every miner prioritizes shareholder value and it’s important to do your own research before buying into these higher risk stocks which are now trading at a much cheaper price.\n\nCLSK has set itself up to be most shareholder friendly BtC holder this bull run. Factors that support CLSK include NO plans for additional ATM's, full funding for growth to 50 EH/s and industry low % revenue going to compensation (Figure 4). Unlike MARA (48.4%) and RIOT (79%), IREN and CLSK have only 29.24% and 24.38% of revenue going towards paying compensation (which is good for shareholders). On 1/10/2025, MARA announced a 300M dilution which will dilute current shareholders by 60%. Because MARA has 333M shares, this potentially means each MARA share can drop close to 50% within a day whenever this dilution gets processed. Furthermore, plans to grow by 7 EH/s and/or pursue HPC-AI means RIOT may likely seek another $750M ATM at the cost of shareholders.\n\nOkay, okay… so what does this all mean? To figure that out, we have to take a look at some numbers...\n\nCLSK will likely have the highest amount BTC holdings in June 2025 per dollar spent TODAY on CLSK shares REGARDLESS of BTC price at $80k, $100k, $120k or $150k. This is based on figures which add up current BTC holdings and projected mining revenue (Figures 5 to 8) with averaged out monthly growth based on current EH/s goals. The amount held in BTC is then divided by market cap (corrected for dilution and ATM) to give the projected percent BTC holding per market cap as shown by Figure 1.\n\nThis means that buying CLSK now is worth MORE BTC later. It also means CLSK has MORE EFFICIENT mining operations that are misappropriately valued LESS than worse mining operations by RIOT and MARA. The goal in buying BTC miners is to pick a company that acquires BTC cheaper which generates enough profit to outpace the gains one gets buying BTC. Unlike CLSK whose competitive advantage is finding sites at low cost, RIOT and MARA copied MSTR and took out loans via convertible notes to buy spot BTC. This artificially raised their BTC holdings and only leads to further release of ATM’s and/or dilution at the expense of shareholders tomorrow.\n\nOut of good faith to those interested, I investigated this industry and formed my opinions based on the numbers I have observed. For CLSK, TTM price-to-sale (P/S) will likely drop by June 2025 to \\~3.58 (which indicates \\~2x value at current prices). CLSK had 39.1 EH/s with revenue of 668 BTC ($70.2M) in December 2024 which beat average revenue of 514 BTC from May 2024 to November 2024. With CLSK fully funding growth of 11.9 more EH/s (30.4%) by H1 2025, CLSK revenue will increase monthly by \\~5% for a TTM annual revenue of 8,070 BTC ($807M).\n\nThe lower projected 3.58 P/S for CLSK is NOT priced in and does NOT account for holdings which would be \\~13913 BTC ($1.39B) by June 2025 at $100k. If BTC reaches $150k by mid 2025, industry low cost of \\~$64k per coin mined means CLSK makes \\~$694M PROFIT from July 2024 to June 2025. This means CLSK would make $50k MORE PROFIT per coin mined than each coin RIOT and MARA bought at \\~$100k. This is where the REAL value lies with mining stocks. If done efficiently, profits can be made, and shareholders can benefit too.\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided above is for general informational and educational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice.

    "title": "Why Prediction Markets Will Be the Future of Crypto",
    "selftext": "Crypto has gone through a lot of trends—Bitcoin as “digital gold,” Ethereum and smart contracts, DeFi, NFTs, and whatever else people have hyped up. But one of the most interesting (and underrated) use cases is prediction markets. I honestly think they could be a huge part of crypto’s future.\n\n# What’s a prediction market?\n\nIt’s basically a way to bet on real-world events—elections, sports, stock prices, anything. If you think something will happen, you buy “Yes” shares. If you think it won’t, you buy “No” shares. The price moves based on what people believe the probability is. It’s like a stock market for real-world events.\n\n# Why does this matter for crypto?\n\n* They’re actually useful – Instead of just trading meme coins, prediction markets provide real-world value by showing what people *really* think will happen.\n* Less censorship – A lot of places ban certain types of betting (especially political betting), but decentralized markets are harder to shut down.\n* One of the best real uses for crypto – People always ask what crypto is actually *good for*. This is one of the best answers.\n* Better than traditional betting – No middlemen, lower fees, and the odds are set by the market instead of bookies.\n\nPlatforms like Polymarket and Augur are already doing this, but it still feels early. If crypto is going to have real-world applications, **prediction markets could be one of the biggest.**\n\nCurious to hear what others think—are prediction markets the next big thing, or is something holding them back?",

With a touch of his fingerprint, his digital assets are protected inside his **sBox**. And if something happens, there’s no need for a seed phrase—you inherit access seamlessly through biometric authentication.\n\nSo, What Exactly is **DeDaSP**?\n\n**DeDaSP** ensures your data, assets, and access rights don’t just stay safe—they survive. Unlike traditional storage that can be lost, stolen, hacked, or destroyed, **DeDaSP** is designed for true longevity.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\n🔹 Biometric authentication – No passwords, no lost phrases. Your fingerprint is your key.\n\n🔹 Recursive succession – Multiple successors can inherit access, ensuring your data is never lost.\n\n🔹 On-chain security – Fully decentralized, meaning no single point of failure.\n\n🔹 NFT Sharding – Access keys are split into secure, on-chain fragments, eliminating loss risks.\n\nWhy Does This Matter?\n\nBillions in crypto are permanently lost because owners forgot passwords, lost wallets, or had no succession plan. Serenity solves this for good:\n\n✅ Lost your backup in a disaster? You can still recover access.\n\n✅ Lost your phone or hardware wallet? No problem—your biometric login remains.\n\n✅ Something happens to you? Your successor inherits access instantly, without lawyers, court orders, or endless paperwork.\n\n**Serenity**: Setting a New Standard\n\nToday, **DeDaSP** is Serenity’s breakthrough protocol. Tomorrow, it will be the industry standard. Just like HTTPS became the foundation of internet security, **DeDaSP** is redefining digital asset protection.\n\nA future where your data, identity, and assets truly belong to you?\n\nSerenity is already building it.  \n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/serenity-shield/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/serenity-shield/)",

I’ve been DCAing small amounts for a while but this is a larger sum.\n\nFor context: I sold my car and moved to a walkable city last year, so this money is my “future fund.” I’m risk-aware but don’t want to gamble. My plan is to spread buys over 12-24 months, but I’m second-guessing everything:\n\nWhat exchanges are the go-to for Europeans? I keep hearing horror stories about withdrawals getting frozen.\n\nAlso, everyone says “just DCA and hold,” but are there actually better methods for larger sums? I’ve never managed this much money before. Especially worried about entering at this point in the market. \n\nNo ego here, roast my plan if needed. Just don’t want to regret this in 5 years.

    "selftext": "Alright I'm looking for some advice here on risk management/strategy.  I figured this sub is best to ask.  I hold some bitcoin and have for like 10 years.  Never sold a thing, had a conviction then, and still have it now.  I expect price will still at least double this year.\n\n  \nProblem is right now I need some money, and let's say I need 100k for simplicity.   I could sell 1btc, take the profit quick and simple, but then potentially lose out on \\~100k in future gains.  \n\n  \nOr, I could put 2btc up for collateral, pay 12k interest, and get 100k loan.  If price doubles, I would be saving 88k in this scenario.  But obviously there is the counterparty risk of losing 2btc.  There's also some risk of liquidation if things go south.\n\n  \nI do plan to sell/trade/diversify my stack this year anyhow.  So the cap gains isn't a huge consideration. \n\n  \nWhat would you do?  Take the easy/simple profit and move on with life,  or let it ride and find/manage a btc backed loan, and try to maximize gains at all costs?  I'm not risk averse, it's how I got here in the first place.  But I want to make the smartest decision. \n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm planning to get in the market in a bit after researching quite a while about bitcoin and xrp. Both really fascinates me and believe both could co exist in the future to create the future of financial technology.\n\nThis is what I got and please correct me if I have mistakes and I'm open for discussion down in the comment sections so feel free! \n\n**Key Differences Between Bitcoin and XRP Algorithms**\n\n**Consensus Mechanism**:\n\n* **Bitcoin**: Uses **Proof of Work (PoW)**, where miners solve complex cryptographic puzzles to validate transactions and add blocks to the blockchain. This process is **energy-intensive** and relatively **slow**.\n* **XRP (Ripple)**: Uses the **Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm (RPCA)**, which relies on a network of **trusted validators (Will talk about these later)** to reach consensus on transactions. It is **faster**, more **energy-efficient**, and does not require mining.\n\n  \n**Transaction Speed**:\n\n* **Bitcoin**: **10 minutes** on average due to the time required to mine each block.\n* **XRP**:  **3-5 seconds** due to its lightweight consensus algorithm. Very fast.\n\n  \n**Scalability (TPS-wise)**:\n\n* **Bitcoin**: Processes about **7 transactions per second (TPS)**. Scaling has been a challenge due to its block size and consensus model (?)\n* **XRP**: Can handle up to **1,500 TPS**, making it more suitable for large-scale, high-frequency use cases like global payments.\n\n  \n**Purpose**:\n\n* **Bitcoin**: Designed as a **decentralized digital currency** and store of value, often referred to as \"digital gold.\"\n* **XRP**: Primarily developed as a **bridge currency** for cross-border payments and facilitating fast, low-cost transfers between financial institutions.\n\n# Combined Benefits for Financial Technology:\n\n1. **Improved Efficiency**: Bitcoin’s decentralization and XRP’s speed/low cost can complement each other in creating hybrid systems that are both secure and scalable.\n2. **Reduced Costs**: Both cryptocurrencies eliminate the need for traditional intermediaries, reducing inefficiencies in transaction and operational costs between countries.\n3. **Innovation in Payment Systems**: By integrating blockchain technology, Bitcoin and XRP can inspire new solutions for digital payments, lending, and \"**ASSET\"** tokenization.\n\n  \nSome questions that I have:\n\n1. Can both co-exist with each other later?  \n2. Is XRP decentralized or centralized?  \n\n* Validators on the XRP Ledger include universities, financial institutions, and independent organizations, making the network less reliant on Ripple Labs.\n* Since Ripple Labs created XRP and still holds a significant portion of its supply (over 40 billion XRP in escrow). This concentration of ownership can give Ripple Labs significant influence over the XRP market, defeat the purpose of decentralized currency like bitcoin.\n\n  \nPlease correct me if I have any mistakes and I hope we could learn from each other :) Thank you!",

Their approach integrates the LN with the Fiber Network to create a Hybrid Network, introducing stablecoins, automated liquidity management, and zero-cost channel opening.\n\nKey features include:\n\n1. **Decentralized Liquidity Staking Pool (DLSP):** Improves liquidity efficiency by enabling liquid staking derivatives and automated management.\n2. **Hybrid Network:** Integrates LN with Fiber Network for stablecoin support and better connectivity, so you can pay with bitcoin and merchant receives USD stablecoin\n3. **Zero-Cost Onboarding:** Simplifies LN adoption by advancing funds for channel setup.\n\nThey also propose use cases like decentralized swaps, AI agent payments, and composability with DeFi. The project aims to create a scalable, user-friendly payment system aligned with Web5 principles.\n\nWhat do you think about this solution? Can it truly address LN's challenges and drive mass adoption?\n\nSource: [https://www.utxostack.network/](https://www.utxostack.network/)\n\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nervos-network/",

    "selftext": "ANARCHY on SOL is taking crypto back to its roots and making it anarchic again! Remember when crypto was supposed to be disruptive tech? Well ANARCHY is everything a cryptocurrency is supposed to be: truly decentralized with fair distribution. Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are inherently anarchistic.\n\nOne needs to look no further than Satoshi’s Bitcoin White Paper to see that anarchist ideas inspired Satoshi to create BTC. The White Paper’s first footnote gives a nod of approval to the b-money proposal developed by cypherpunk Wei Dai, with whom Satoshi had a history of correspondence with. The proposal opens with, “I am fascinated by Tim May’s crypto-anarchy. Unlike the communities traditionally associated with the word ‘anarchy’, in a crypto-anarchy the government is not temporarily destroyed but permanently forbidden and permanently unnecessary.” \n\nBoth cryptocurrency and anarchism stand for decentralization, anti-authoritarianism, anti-establishment, reacting against corrupt governments and financial institutions, and the importance of strong community. According to crypto-anarchist writer Sterlin Lujan, “Bitcoin was meant to function as a monetary weapon, as a cryptocurrency poised to undermine authority.” \n\nUnfortunately, cryptocurrency has now been hijacked by bankers, governments, and billionaires, all the things that cryptocurrency was created to combat! It’s time to return control of our finances back to the the people.\n\nANARCHY honors its past while lighting the way for a new age in crypto. This movement has reignited a desire to bring back the revolutionary and subversive aspects of cryptocurrency. If you’re tired of the same repetitive and hackneyed meme coins, look no further! We have the message and the conviction needed to make crypto anarchic again!\n\nCA:\n\nGYPxyPtu6g1NmnEPPkTcCdSZz7ZMs6A1S3wTjnLdpump\n\nWebsite:\n\nhttps://anarchyonsol.com\n\nReddit:\n\nr/AnarchyOnSol \n\nhttps://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/anarchy-2",

    "title": "Post Emergency Analysis PSA: What went right and wrong (but mostly wrong) when I thought evacuation was imminent.",
    "selftext": "This is a tale of a dry run for an emergency-driven backup plan for a btc wallet. When it was happening, however, I did not know it was only going to be a dry run, and so it felt more like a descent into hell. But note: [As I mentioned in my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1hxwvz9/comment/m6fuo5a/), everything turned out OK, the fire guys did astounding work, and there was ultimately no danger to us or our home. I’m recounting the tale only so that some of you might benefit from our experience. \n\nLet me give you the punchline first: Your backup plan cannot be independent of a general life plan. You need to consider some pretty far out edge cases. I’m sure many of you have done that, but it is worth taking 10 minutes to double check your plan against my story to test the robustness of your plan. If you don’t want to read a wall of text, skip to the bullet summary at the bottom. \n\nMy story of descent into hell starts with my wife and I out for a small nearby hike. At the very end of the hike, I thought I smelled smoke but assumed it was because of the big LA fires just a few miles south of us (these are the ones you have seen on the news.) It turns out that the smoke was probably the beginning of the new Kenneth fire. Shortly after we got home, there was a large plume of smoke and then it was clear this was a new fire. The winds were high and most of the fire fighters were working on the big LA fires so it was hard to know how it would evolve. Within about 10 minutes, we got an “evacuation warning” on our cell phones.  In the language of public emergency messages “evacuation warning” means pack up and get ready to leave, while “evacuation order” means get out and go now.\n\n As it turns out, we had a written list of items to pull together for evacuations, so I pulled that out and started working through the list as calmly as I could manage. When I got to the wallet thumb drive, I went to where it was supposed to be and my heart sank: It was not there. Around this time, the sheriff drives by with a bullhorn and I thought he was telling us to evac now. At this point, I am relieved that I have a backup drive with a relative far away, because my wife has a number of medical issues and reduced mobility, so I just don’t have time to figure out why my thumb drive is not where it is supposed to be.  I gather up a few more things and head out to the car and make sure the wife is ready, because for all I know this is the last time we see our house before it joins the many smoldering ruins that we’ve seen on the news. \n\nNow it turns out (thank all the gods) that this was as far into hell as we descended. The actual end of the story went like this: I went outside, and my neighbors were talking to a firefighter. He told us that as long as the winds did not shift, we would likely not have to evacuate, which meant that I had misunderstood what the sheriff driving around with a bullhorn was saying.  (The sheriff was making sure that everyone knew we should prepare to evacuate in case they missed the cell phone message, and the key thing that I misheard is that people *who need a lot of time* should go now.) The fire then grew to about a 1000 acres before it was officially stopped. I will never let a fire fighter buy his own drink from now on. \n\nHowever, just before going outside and learning that we were probably going to be OK, there were about a million thoughts racing through my head about how inadequately I had prepared for the possible endings. Now, I thought I was prepared (I had a list! I had a portable backup drive!) but what was most missing from my emergency planning: For a long-time hodler, life is going to change. Your spouse might develop a serious medical issue, and your parent might start showing signs of dementia. You might need to take care of an injured spouse during evacuation, and you will have precisely zero time to allot to your wallet backup plan, because (trust me on this): What is ultimately important becomes screamingly obvious during such moments, and it turns out that btc is not at the top of your list. \n\nMemorizing passphrases etc is good and all, but you are going to age too. You may suffer an injury in the disaster you are escaping from and you yourself will start experiencing memory loss. So whatever password is only in your head? Definitely rethink that strategy.\n\nThat drive you left with an aging parent? They did not know (or did not remember) that you thought it was important. They are preparing to sell their home and downsize, so it went into the trash. (This was roughly true in my case, as I found out later that week. *That* would have been a bad surprise.)\n\nHow about where you are going to escape to? Cell phone service was essentially dead. There are bars on the phone (the cell towers are active) but within certain cells you cannot get data or a phone call out. I hope that 911 service was still there (I sure as hell wasn’t going to test it without an actual emergency, those guys were full of them already) and that is why the cell service was alive at all. So you will need some type of offline map. You may think you know the roads, but imagine everyone in your area leaving: Do you know the side roads? How far away?  As you probably heard, there were cases were folks needed to walk away from their cars. This happened because those particular roads were funnels with no productive side streets to utilize. [In one report](https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/residents-evacuate-and-flee-as-palisades-fire-grows/), LAFD told people to get out of their cars to escape the flames and then the fire depts bulldozed them out of the way, and [in another](https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/los-angeles-wildfire-windstorm-01-07-25#cm5n82fuo00003b6m6dg9oc1x) report, folks considered heading to the beach in order to escape the flames. \n\nThere is even the case that you are not allowed into your home: When coming back from the hike, I already smelled the smoke. But a little while later, and our path would have been blocked. Does your backup plan include geodiverse recovery? It very much needs to. \n\nTo give you a sense of the blindness that will occur as you are trying to calmly exit and not panic: My backup USB was just a little further down on the shelf. It is now part of a go-bag that I will keep and review every N months (N=6? I think), so that there is one less item to grab. \n\nSo in summary, there are three cases:\n\n* When you are away and your house evaporates for some reason: Have a geodiverse backup, independent of people if possible.\n* When there is no time to pack: Grab your [go-bag](https://news.caloes.ca.gov/grab-and-go-bag/), btc backup should be in it.\n* When there is time to pack: Grab your [go-bag](https://news.caloes.ca.gov/grab-and-go-bag/) with your btc backup, have a written list of other things to pack. The top of the list should be things you grab first in case you don't have time to grab them all.",

    "title": "$ANARCHY - Anarchy’s Place in DeFi - Something has changed in crypto…",
    "selftext": "Something has changed in crypto… and ANARCHY on SOL is at the forefront. \n\nLike any compelling story, the cryptocurrency market has a rich, intricate history that lays the foundation for its current state. This analysis focuses on the present condition of the cryptocurrency market during this bull run, particularly the alt coin segment.\n\nThere’s been a noticeable shift in the mindset of many crypto investors. In this new age, where Bitcoin and Ethereum have proven their financial dominance, years of overhyped and underdelivered projects have left investors jaded. From eager newcomers to seasoned pros chasing the next big opportunity, the once easily attainable, high-yielding gains of crypto are now buried deeper in the abyss.\n\nIn previous runs, memes were part of the chaos, but they’ve now become a part of the main act. Every bull cycle has seen their popularity grow, and this time, they’ve taken a portion of the center stage. But what does that say about the space?\n\nIn the past, investors often bought into elaborate, long-winded vaporware projects, convinced they would provide real-world utility. Sure, many of these projects were outright trash, but that didn’t mean they weren’t profitable at least for the early movers. While the aim was always to generate wealth, there was often a hope, conscious or not, that these investments might also offer sustainability or longevity.\n\nBut as we’ve all seen or painfully experienced those gains often found their way back to the beast that created them. Alt season, after all, was never much more than a game of profit rotation. Hot or ridiculous, useful or useless, it didn’t matter. What mattered was what could convince the market, what held the most conviction, and what the hottest narrative was at the time.\n\nThis is where the mentality began to shift. The crypto game has always been risky that’s a given. But something has fundamentally changed. Investors are consciously or unconsciously beginning to realize that power in crypto was never about the project itself, Whether it boasted faster transactions or groundbreaking technology. The real power has always been in the community: the people who believe, support, and build momentum. This is why ‘meme coins’ have been revolutionary. They’ve proven that belief and collective energy can move markets, even without tangible utility.\n\nBut that belief, the very fabric of what made the crypto revolution special has been eroded. There only handful of true memes out there. The concept in itself has left many investors exposed to toxic actors, scams, rug pulls, and shadowy cabals. What was once about empowerment has become a dangerous minefield for the unwary.\n\nAnd yet, amidst the darkness, there are glimmers of hope. At this point I’d like to remind you that Anarchy’s message is Fuck the rugs, fuck scams &amp; fuck the cabals. Are you ready to be part of something bigger? Let's show the world what true anarchy looks like.\n\nCA:\n\nGYPxyPtu6g1NmnEPPkTcCdSZz7ZMs6A1S3wTjnLdpump\n\nWebsite:\n\nhttps://anarchyonsol.com\n\nReddit:\n\nr/AnarchyOnSol\n\nhttps://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/anarchy-2",

    "title": "Big Round Numbers Theory",
    "selftext": "I have a theory, that each cycle has a big round target (x) that is 10 times higher than previous cycle target (y), because people like big round numbers:\n    \n\n    Cycle 1: x=100, y=N/A\n    Cycle 2: x=1K, y=100\n    Cycle 3: x=10K, y=1K\n    Cycle 4: x=100K, y=10K\n    Cycle 5: x=1M, y=100K\n\n&gt; Fun fact: Cycle 1 reached only 0.3x and never hit the target of x=100. This was because the first exchange and trading appeared only when the cycle was already two years old. Additionally, the price of Bitcoin was incorrectly set to $0.06 at the start of trading, so the price had to increase by more than three orders of magnitude in just two years — a tall order even for Bitcoin. Two years into mining, the fair price of Bitcoin should have been $6 at the start of trading, given the value it was already providing. Cycle 1 is usually excluded from the comparison charts due to its short time span and extreme volatility.\n\nNow, let’s compare cycles 2-5 visually using targets x and y defined above.\n\nMy favorite cycle comparison chart is [Bitcoin Price After Halvings](https://x.com/HalvingTracker), however it suffers from two problems:\n\n* **Problem 1**: it creates the false impression of diminishing returns due to unfortunate choice of vertical scaling, horizontal alignment and cycle definition.\n* **Problem 2**: it doesn't show very well where we are in the current cycle in respect to common cycle stages for the same reasons.\n\nNow, let’s improve each of these aspects.\n\n# Better Vertical Scaling\n\nLet’s scale this chart to cycle targets x and y defined above: https://imgur.com/a/mkdykNs\n\n# Better Horizontal Alignment\n\nWhile cycles vary in how quick the bull run starts (e.g., 2020 bull run was notoriously early to start), once the price moves past 1.4y, all cycles behave pretty much the same by shooting almost straight up, so let’s align cycles horizontally to this point in each cycle: https://imgur.com/a/5a58yUu\n\n# Better Cycle Definition\n\nHalvings don’t impact the price immediately and the price just fluctuates after halving boringly for variable number of months in each cycle, so let’s set cycle start to a time when the price moves past approximately 0.6y for the last time, because this is where the real action begins, and cycles start to move in sync: https://imgur.com/a/olJnSyZ\n\nCompared to cycles defined by halving dates, dates of my cycles are offset by 1 to 8 months.\n\nIn this chart we finally begin to clearly see common cycle stages:\n\n1. **Fight With Previous Target** – in the first stage all cycles start to immediately tackle the first mini-boss – previous cycle target y. A lot of people want to cash out during this stage, so it takes a lot of time – about 210 days, during which we range between 0.7y and 1.3y. Zoom to stage 1: https://imgur.com/a/GEMshA9\n\n2. **Bull Run** – after slaying the first mini-boss, price shoots almost vertically up towards cycle target x. In this short second stage, we do or do not reach cycle target x, depending largely on the timing of the next China ban. \n\n3. **Bear Market** – in this stage we never fall below 1.5y (cycle 2 – $152, cycle 4 – $15,479).\n\n4. **Recovery** – the last stage, when price recovers to a level that is higher by a factor of 10 (f10) compared to cycle start. We stay at approximately f10 price level for varying months until this cycle ends and new cycle begins.\n\nHere are all the cycles with start and end dates, start and end price, ratio between end/start price and cycle lengths:\n\n\n\n    Cycle 1: 2010-10-07 ($0.06) – 2013-03-20 ($61.7) – 965.32 – 895 days\n    Cycle 2: 2013-03-20 ($61.7) – 2016-10-05 ($611) – 9.90 – 1295 days\n    Cycle 3: 2016-10-05 ($611) – 2020-04-10 ($6877) – 11.26 – 1273 days\n    Cycle 4: 2020-04-10 ($6877) – 2024-10-24 ($68155) – 9.91 – 1658 days\n    Cycle 5: 2024-10-24 ($68155) – ? – 10 – 81 days so far\n\nRemarkably, in no cycle have we failed to recover to f10 in the last stage, and this is the main reason why we can expect this cycle to be no different.\n\nWhat changes though, is time required to do it.\n\nAlthough duration of cycle 4 of 1658 days seems alarming, we actually reached f10 price during recovery by day 1424 – still under 4 years.  Additionally, cycle 4 was notoriously ahead of cycle 3 in timing at the cost of cycle 3 duration decrease and cycle 4 duration increase. Assuming cycle 4 early bull run was a random artifact and time-to-f10 should increase gradually, let’s shift time-to-f10 for cycles 3 and 4 to follow linear growth:\n\n    Cycle 2: 1295\n    Cycle 3: 1273 + 58 = 1331\n    Cycle 4: 1424 – 58 = 1366\n\nWe can also extrapolate time-to-f10 for cycle 5 if we continue that linear growth:\n\n    Cycle 5: 1366 + 35 = 1401\n\nGiven this duration, we can predict cycle 5 date of recovery to f10, by adding 1401 days to cycle start date:\n\n    Cycle 5: 2024-10-24 ($68155) – 2028-08-25 ($681550)\n\nThe consistent tenfold increase in Bitcoin price over the last three cycles disproves the theory of diminishing returns. What actually diminishes is the bottom-to-top range, which is difficult to time anyway. I would take a guaranteed and easily timed 900% return every 4 years over better bottom-to-top returns any day. The fact that time-to-f10 increases every cycle by a month and cycle length increases by a few months doesn’t look like a big concern for now as long as increase remains linear. Cycle length increase is expected due to the increasing market cap.\n\nThe last remaining question is the alignment of the current cycle on the chart with respect to other cycles. Obviously, we don’t know when will we shoot past 1.4y in this bull run so we cannot align it precisely yet. Using definition of cycle start as a point when the price moves past approximately 0.6y for the last time gives us a few days’ leeway. It is tempting to choose 2024-10-24 as the day of cycle start for now, because it gives unbelievably good fit to the last cycle: https://imgur.com/a/ZlKYCF3\n\nCycle 5 mirrors cycle 4 over the last 104 days with a correlation of R^2 = 0.93, but with less volatility.\n\nNow that we supposedly know where we are, here are some predictions:\n\n1. We are 81 days into the 210 days of the first stage, the first boss fight is 39% complete and its health bar is already at 61%.\n2. We will cross the point of no return at 140K in 129 days on May 22.\n3. Barring China ban and assuming we sustain cycle 3 and cycle 4 growth rate, we will reach 1M in another 210 days on December 18.\n4. Hopefully, we will peak at 1.337M, so I can win the [Guess The High](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1hr2ybo/2025_guess_the_high_contest/) contest.\n5. We fill not fall below 150K in the bear market.\n6. We will recover to 680K on August 25, 2028.\n7. Cycle 6 will start a few months later with a target of 10M.\n\nEvery good theory must be falsifiable, so what benchmarks can we observe?\n\nIf stage 1 lasts two times longer, say 400 days, or we don’t shoot past 140K but start fighting it instead, I’d be concerned.\n\nIf we observe exponential rather than linear time-to-f10 growth in this and next cycles, both this theory and Bitcoin will be dead.\n\nP.S. One can argue for an existence of a channel in the first stage, if you ignore cycle 2 wicks (is it even legal to do a TA on a cycle comparison chart? lol): https://imgur.com/a/2Xzgzq2\n\nChannel bottom is currently at 75K.",

    "title": "Advice on Investing in Bitcoin: Spot vs. Futures + Modified DCA Strategy",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI’m looking for advice and opinions from more experienced investors regarding my current Bitcoin investment strategy. I’m set on using a DCA (dollar-cost averaging) methodology, but with a bit of a twist. Instead of buying regularly at fixed intervals, I accumulate Bitcoin over time and occasionally increase my investment when the market dips significantly.\n\nCurrently, I’m using Binance to trade futures contracts and take long positions. My strategy looks something like this:\n\n1. I buy futures long contracts periodically, following a modified DCA approach.\n2. I use low leverage, typically 3x, to manage risk.\n3. When the market experiences a sharp dip, I increase my investment slightly more than usual to take advantage of the opportunity.\n4. When the position reaches a certain percentage of profit (depending on market conditions), I sell and lock in the gains.\n\nThe Issue:\n\nI’m worried about the funding fees that come with futures. I understand that these fees slowly eat into my position’s value over time, which means that if I hold a position for too long, a chunk of the profit goes towards these maintenance costs.\n\nMy Questions for You:\n\n1. Would it make more sense to switch entirely to the spot market, trade Bitcoin there, and avoid the funding fees? I’m not looking to hold BTC long term—I just want to profit from trading. However, with spot trading, I lose the ability to use leverage, which could limit my returns.\n2. Does it make sense to stick with futures contracts and my modified DCA strategy using low leverage (3x)? This approach allows me to grow my position faster and take advantage of leverage, but the funding fees are a concern.\n\nWhat would you recommend for someone who:\n\n* Trades on Binance and is familiar with the platform.\n* Wants to profit from BTC price movements rather than holding it long term.\n* Prefers to use low leverage to minimize risks (3x).\n* Occasionally increases investments during significant market dips to take advantage of lower prices.\n* Is actively monitoring the market and trades regularly.\n\nI’m also curious about your experiences with funding fees and whether anyone has successfully used futures with a low-leverage DCA strategy on Binance. Thanks in advance for any advice!",

    "title": "El Salvador Trip Report",
    "selftext": "Keeping this out of the daily because it’s not strictly market-related, but wanted to post it here on this sub because some of you may find it helpful, and because it’s my Reddit home (at the risk of sounding corny) …\n\nJust got back from a week in El Salvador with family including kids. Here’s my report:\n\nBITCOIN:\n\n- Bitcoin use was hit or miss. I offered to pay our driver in Bitcoin, but he wanted a 25% premium due to volatility. I ended up sending it Western Union (which was a pain in the butt), and paying the remainder in cash. Another person I met said their driver preferred payment in Bitcoin though - he found his driver through a Bitcoiner / Salvador person on X, which seems like a good option for contacts in the country. And I spoke with a hotelier in a rural town (Suchitoto) who has a German elderly couple that’s been staying there for a year and a half and pays in Bitcoin. Much more Bitcoin adoption in El Zonte (Bitcoin Beach), but we didn’t go there. We stayed in quiet areas and visited cities and I hardly saw any Bitcoin adoption to be honest. Still room for growth for sure.\n\n- Downtown San Salvador on Christmas Day had a Christmas Market, and part of it was sponsored by Tether. Big Tether and Bitcoin symbols all over the display. Interesting.\n\nCOUNTRY OBSERVATIONS:\n\n- It’s incredibly safe. Walked around town at night, left doors unlocked, belongings unsecured on the beach, zero problems. Lots of police and military around city centers and tourist sites. Biggest vices I saw were a few drunk dudes lounging outside the liquor store waiting for it to open in the morning in a rural town, one guy smoking a cigarette, and one guy with a Michael Jordan 23 tat lol. I would not hesitate to come here with my family again. Zero safety concerns.\n\n- Almost zero tourists here. We were the only non-Salvadorans on our plane coming and going, and were met with “Gringo gringo” more than a few times lol. Saw maybe 5 American families our whole stay touring all around the country, and very few other tourists. We were in Costa Rica in the spring, and I thought “man this would have been awesome 20-30 years ago before the hordes of tourists came”. El Salvador is Costa Rica 20-30 years ago.\n\n- The country is beautiful. I’m tempted to move there to be honest. Gorgeous beaches with crystal clear water and black sand, volcanoes, lakes, mountains, Mayan ruins. Beautiful architecture in the old parts of cities and towns. Delicious food. Frankly it’s a paradise untouched by tourism. \n\n- Because it is untouched by tourism, some things feel a bit third-world. No flushing your toilet paper. Driving is crazy. Trash in the alleys and gutters of cities. Horses on the beach. Stray dogs everywhere. If you are a resort-type person, go to Costa Rica. If you like authenticity, El Salvador is perfect. I loved it. My boomer mom would have been mortified. To each their own.\n\n- Bukele is extremely popular, and I understand why. Our driver was constantly pointing out areas that used to be controlled by gangs. You couldn’t drive thru certain areas without paying a bribe. You couldn’t go to some areas at all without being robbed or killed. The gangs ruled every aspect of life and commerce. Now they are totally gone. Easy for foreigners to judge his methods from our comfortable homes, but the Salvadorans who aren’t criminals can finally live their lives. I may have bought a t-shirt with Bukele’s giant face on it. I’m a fan, for now.\n\n- Lots of investment from China building new tourism sites, the new library in San Salvador, bridges and infrastructure. I’m wary of this due to Africa’s experience, but it’s El Salvador’s business not mine.\n\n- Coming from the US, prices are cheap. Like 50% of what I would expect to pay at home. Costa Rica was more expensive than US, El Salvador is super cheap. Pupusas $2. Frozen pina coladas $3-4. One-hour boat tour of the lake $25 for 8 people. If you’re considering ExpatFIRE, El Salvador should be on the list.\n\n- The people are incredibly welcoming and warm. Almost no English speakers, so some Spanish is a must (can hobble by on Google Translate). Having people thank you for visiting their country is a nice feeling, and high contrast to somewhere like Europe. Lots of smiles and efforts to be helpful. Street vendors were not aggressive at all. \n\n- Sites visited: San Salvador, Playa San Blas, Surf City / Libertad, Sunzal beach, Tazumal ruins, Santa Ana volcano, Lake Coatapeque, Boqueron, Tamanique waterfalls, Suchitoto, Devil’s Door. \n\nI think that’s all. To sum it up - awesome experience and will go back again. Bitcoin adoption still has a long way to go. \n\nHappy to answer questions or DMs. \n\nEdit: Forgot to mention that the currency is the US dollar, which makes it super simple for Americans - no currency math for each transaction, and no changing money or trying to spend the last of it before coming home.",

    "selftext": "After several failed airdrop projects, the OG Community managed to surprise many of us. Although the distribution is yet to be completed, I believe this project has exceeded my expectations. It's genuinely focused on community growth and offering earning opportunities. Despite the FUD around the distribution, the admins have continued to engage with the community, providing explanations when necessary, which demonstrates their commitment.\n\n  \nThe listing price didn't disappoint; I was expecting it to be lower given previous experiences with overhyped projects. My allocation was satisfactory, especially when combined with the tokens I received from Bitget's Poolx where I had staked some BTC. Some friends who staked ETH also earned a good amount of airdrop from the exchange, providing another stream of passive income. Interestingly, a couple of friends who initially doubted the project ended up receiving tokens from Poolx, which will continue until January 1st. Did you miss out on this airdrop?\n\n[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ogc](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ogc)",

    "selftext": "Alright lads, in an effort to justify my existence here beyond just shitposting, I’ve whipped up a **BTC Cycle Top Indicator Spreadsheet**. Shoutout to u/btc-_- for the inspiration (pour one out for the legend, who seems to have ghosted us).\n\nThis is version 1.0, so feel free to roast me with constructive criticism—anything to make this spreadsheet more *signal* than *noise*. Formatting tweaks, broken links, useless indicators to axe, new ones to add—hit me with it all.\n\nThe plan is to update this bad boy once or twice a month, but if the market starts getting *spicy*, you bet your ass I’ll be posting it daily. Honestly, I’m looking forward to those chaotic times. Anyway, here it is—go easy on me (or don’t).\n\n|Indicator Description|Indicator &amp; Link|December 29 Value|Flashing?|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|The monthly Relative Strength Index (RSI) chart for Bitcoin is king. Comparing the RSI to where previous tops have petered out can show when Bitcoin is overheated. Each cycle is likely to show a smaller RSI peak, so a decline in max RSI over time is expected.|[Monthly RSI &gt;80](https://charts.bitbo.io/monthly-rsi/)|75.5|No|\n|The monthly Logarithmic Moving Average Convergence Divergence (LMACD) has been on a macro downtrend. Each cycle top has gotten very close to this down slope. In April 2021, LMACD hit 0.41, and the trendline was at 0.44 (93% of the way to hitting it).|[LMACD within 10% of the down trend line](https://postimg.cc/ZvFtXTbZ)|0.05|No|\n|The Pi Cycle Top Indicator has been an easy way to determine if things are overheated.|[Pi Cycle Top Crosses](https://charts.bitbo.io/pi-cycle-top/)|Top is 133k|No|\n|The MVRV Z-Score measures how far Bitcoin’s market value is from its realized value in standard deviations, highlighting periods of extreme overvaluation or undervaluation. It improves on the MVRV ratio by standardizing data for better comparisons across market cycles.|[MVRV Z-Score &gt;6](https://charts.bitbo.io/mvrv-z-score/)|2.59|No|\n|The Power Law Chart is a linear regression channel based on historical Bitcoin price. It represents the correlation between Bitcoin’s price and time and has been remarkably accurate.|[Halfway up the 'top channel'](https://charts.bitbo.io/long-term-power-law/)|Currently bottom of 'top channel'|No|\n|Transaction volume measures the economic throughput of BTC on the blockchain. Onchain Volume reflects the total cryptocurrency moving between wallets on a blockchain, giving insight into network health. Monthly volume exceeding $5 trillion—and reaching an all-time high of $8 trillion—signals significant activity.|[Monthly Volume &gt;$5T, then &gt;$8T](https://www.theblock.co/data/on-chain-metrics/bitcoin/bitcoins-adjusted-on-chain-volume-daily)|2.0T|No|\n|The Bitcoin Rainbow Chart is a Halving Price Regression (HPR) is a non-linear logarithmic trend line based solely on Bitcoin prices at the three halving dates, excluding hype cycles to provide a conservative price forecast, with colored bands indicating years ahead of the trend.|[Price moves into Orange Band](https://charts.bitbo.io/rainbow/)|Green Band|No|\n|Altcoin Season Index refers to a market phase where alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) outperform Bitcoin in terms of price growth. The Altcoin Season Index measures this by analyzing the performance of the top 50 altcoins compared to Bitcoin over a given period. A high index score suggests a strong altcoin season, while a low score indicates Bitcoin dominance|[AltSeason Index score &gt;90](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/en/altcoin-season-index/)|49|No|\n|Historically, Bitcoin Transaction Fees Spike during bull market peaks. If daily transaction fees exceed $40, it usually signals overheating.|[Bitcoin average daily transaction fee &gt;$40](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#alltime)|$1.75|No|\n|The Volatility-Adjusted Power Law Index (VPLI) adjusts for volatility to provide clearer value regions across Bitcoin’s lifecycle. When red values appear and begin to decline, it aligns with market cycle tops.|[VPLI Red Zone Indicates Cycle Tops (&gt;85)](https://www.bitcoingoodfiatbad.com/charts/power-law-volatility-adjusted-index)|Green, 60|No|\n|When Bitcoin Dominance sharply drops (15-20% over 4 weeks), it signals lost momentum, with capital flowing into altcoins or stablecoins. Historically, a dominance level under 47% aligns with market pullbacks.|[15% Pullback within a month or BTC dominance &lt;47%](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTC.D/)|4% pullback, dominance 58%|No|\n|When the Number of cryptos with a market cap &gt;$1 billion exceeds 200, it often signals overheating. A sustained decline below the 7-week moving average of these coins indicates a market top.|[\\&gt;200 coins &gt;$1B cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/?page=2)|99 coins above 1B|No|\n|Rising Stablecoin Market Cap (e.g., Tether) can reflect higher purchasing power or profit-taking. If the cap increases significantly over 4 months (e.g., &gt;2.5x), it often indicates higher risk.|[USDT cap &gt;2.5x in 4 months](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BvgWh9QV/)|Up about 15%|No|\n|The 200 Week Moving Average Heatmap has historically been a reliable indicator. Orange or red dots on the chart signal market overheating and a good time to sell.|[Orange and Red Dots Appear](https://www.bitcoinmagazinepro.com/charts/200-week-moving-average-heatmap/)|Deep Blue|No|\n|The CBBI Indicator combines 9 metrics to estimate Bitcoin market cycles, helping identify price tops or bottoms.|[Confidence &gt;75/100 = Market Peak](https://colintalkscrypto.com/cbbi/)|79|Yes|\n|The Mayer Multiple, the current Bitcoin price divided by its 200-day moving average, highlights historically significant price ranges. Values above 2.4 suggest market euphoria.|[Over 2.4](https://charts.bitbo.io/mayermultiple/)|1.33|No|\n|The NUPL (Net Unrealized Profit/Loss) metric shows market-wide profit or loss. Values above 0.75 indicate market euphoria and potential tops.|[Over 75%](https://charts.bitbo.io/net-unrealized-profit-loss/)|57%|No|\n|The Terminal Price normalizes historical Bitcoin behavior to current conditions by multiplying Transferred Price by 21 (max supply in millions). This has effectively forecasted cycle peaks.|[Price Rises Above Terminal Price](https://www.bitcoinmagazinepro.com/charts/terminal-price/)|Terminal Price 188k|No|\n|The 4-Year MA Multiple compares the Bitcoin price to its 4-year moving average. Historically, peaks above 4.5x have aligned with market tops.|[Value ≥ 4](https://charts.bitbo.io/sma1458/)|\\~2|No|\n|The Coinbase App Rank hitting the top 10 in mobile store rankings, usually 4 weeks or less before market tops, has historically signaled euphoria.|[Top 10 in App Rankings](https://x.com/COINAppRankBot)|Rank 190|No|\n|Google searches for 'Cheapest Crypto' spiking above 75 (trend score) have historically aligned with market euphoria.|[Trend Score &gt;75](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=cheapest%20crypto&amp;hl=en)|44|No|\n|The Puell Multiple is a metric that evaluates the selling pressure from Bitcoin miners by comparing the daily mining revenue (in USD) to its 365-day simple moving average. It helps traders assess how miners' revenue impacts market dynamics, particularly during periods of forced selling.|[Pay attention above 2.5](https://charts.bitbo.io/puell-multiple/%20)|1.07|No|\n\n",

    "selftext": "The OGC Mining Community isn't just another entry in the blockchain world; it's at the forefront of a revolution where gaming intersects with the earning capabilities of blockchain technology. This project smartly incorporates play-to-earn features, enabling users to earn cryptocurrency through gameplay, task completion, and by staking OGC tokens in its ever-growing ecosystem.   \n  \nWith a cap of 1 billion OGC tokens and a halving mechanism every six months, the project is engineered to foster scarcity, which might elevate its value in the long run. The ecosystem is bolstered by three key platforms: the OGC App, the competitive OGC Arena, and the OGC Marketplace for trading digital assets.  \nAs we near the eagerly awaited listing on December 30th, I find myself regretting not participating in the   \n  \nOGC airdrop, a decision that feels somewhat bittersweet now. Fortunately, the crypto landscape often provides alternative paths, and Bitget's PoolX is one such opportunity, allowing users to lock BTC or ETH to earn OGC tokens before they're widely available. This provides a way for those who missed the airdrop to still get involved early.  \n  \nHowever, the online chatter around OGC is a blend of enthusiasm and apprehension. There's significant concern about the token's pricing once it goes live, leading to a range of sentiments from optimistic to wary. This has given me a cautious yet hopeful outlook. Maybe, in the broader context, not catching the airdrop won't be as detrimental as initially thought; we'll see soon enough as the launch day nears.\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/community/profile/OGCommunity/](https://coinmarketcap.com/community/profile/OGCommunity/)",

    "selftext": "**Kendu events and community**\n\nMore than just a memecoin.\n\nA movement, an identifiable and memorable brand, an inspiring ethos and a community that is consistently winning in engagement, polls and beating records.\n\nFollowing our ethos of \"We do not gamble, we work\" and being guided by community members and a dev who all contributed and built the recipe for Shibs success from day one, the Kendu community has its sights set on the decabillions this cycle.\n\n**Events on the Horizon**\n\nWithin only the next month, Kendu has so many bullish events incoming\n\nWe have just been listed on BiFinance, who boasts 3.4B USD daily trading volume.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zv1jlag6zc9e1.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=352c885147e27a1049bdaded575ad9f642a133ae\n\n  \nThis offers a massive 75x leverage trading for Kendu, which will bring about huge volume and buy ins. To have 75x leverage at the levels we are currently at is insane.\n\n[Certik and Sol](https://preview.redd.it/1r49dbm7zc9e1.png?width=678&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acaae2f7e75089cab9cfce281a02988eac27c279)\n\nNext, we are currently undergoing the certik audit, which is sat at 73%. This Audit is for free as we recently became the second memecoin EVER to complete the 50 000 votes organically - behind Pepe which recently hit 10B marketcap.\n\nIn fact, Certik will even begin running an awareness campaign for Kendu. They did this in the past for Pepe and it saw hundreds of thousands of views.\n\nThis will also bring about a stamp of approval that Kendu is well and truly here to stay.\n\nWe are also on the verge of a Sol bridging via wormhole. This will bring about even more volume and liquidity to the ecosystem, providing access to a whole new world of crypto investors. Within Kendu alone, several community members are eagerly waiting for the bridge as they have thousands of dollars in Sol sat waiting on the sidelines.\n\n[Coinbase](https://preview.redd.it/1tdmtwr8zc9e1.png?width=459&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3d2a5ec34020038010370b2aab665512e237569)\n\nWe have also just been advertised once again by Coinbase. They placed us front and centre on their CB wallet video. They posted this back a few months ago and have now once again reposted it. We are now the only remaining coin they have not yet listed.\n\nThey arent the only T1 Cex praising us for our efforts though. Bitget recently ran a giveaway campaign which saw 8000+ participants, and OKX a seperate campaign to trade Kendu on their wallet. OKX are now running another that will be similar to Bitgets.\n\nso 3 T1 Cexs all going out of their way to showcase Kendu, just because of how hard working our community is.\n\nNext, we have a listing occuring on India's largest exchange CoinDCX. Being the largest in a country the size of India, with global adoption coming about, this brings about even further access to the Kendu brand.\n\nThen we have an NFT platform \"Kendu Chads\" on the horizon. The revenue made in fees from the platform will be used to directly prop up the Kendu Chart, whilst also providing massive war chests of liquidity to pay for T1 listings and other beneficial contributions for the Kendu ecosystem.\n\nSo in just the previous month and now the one incoming:\n\n* 75x leverage on BiFinance\n* Located on Coinbase Wallet advertisement\n* 2 OKX campaigns and a Bitget Campaign\n* CoinDCX listing - Indias largest exchange\n* Sol Bridge\n* Certik Audit and awareness campaign\n* An NFT platform to provide buybacks\n\n**The community and how we thrive in bad market conditions**\n\nJust recently a community member smashed out another Mural in Miami.\n\n[Miami Mural no. 2](https://preview.redd.it/y0ynov0azc9e1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebb572c075150caf6af569685f5d6f85a29d937c)\n\nThis is now the second Miami Mural that will be on display to thousands of people every single day.\n\n\\------\n\nThe entire crypto market has just had a huge correction as well. This is with Eth and BTC absolutely getting destroyed and all the top alts being rocked in a massive way.\n\nBut how did Kendu go?\n\n[Growth during massive market correction](https://preview.redd.it/9ahorqxazc9e1.png?width=667&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a69e8ac35b0057844423e1b1f858b17963820ab)\n\nAs can be seen, we still have been steadily gaining holders even through the massive correction, and are now up 65% from 30 days ago. Our community is diamond handed like no other, and works even through the toughest conditions. We are at a level where there is now zero downside, and these levels are a generational opportunity.\n\n\\------\n\nSo an unmatched community with this much approaching in just the next month alone, and a massive showing of strength during the market correction.\n\nWe are not just here to stay. We are here to thrive.\n\nKendu will never stop until the decabillions, with above being just some examples of why we will be able to do so.\n\nWe are a movement that can not be stopped, with only upside for us.\n\nNow with the greatest memecoin/alt season incoming in 2025, Kendu is absolutely in pole position to take the cycle all the way to the top.\n\nJump in now or at the billions, anon. The choice is yours.\n\nCA: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18  \nCG: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu)  \nCMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)",

Is it correct, or is my mind tricking me? I’ve already done some research, but I couldn’t find anything.

PoS is often hyped as the eco-friendly future of blockchain, but then you’ve got PoW defenders saying, “Hey, we’re more secure and decentralized. That’s worth the energy cost.”\n\nTake Bitcoin it gets so much heat for its energy consumption, but some argue it’s actually pushing renewable energy adoption forward. Then there’s Ethereum, which moved to PoS and cut its energy use massively. But does that centralize power among big stakers? Feels like it’s a tough trade-off either way.\n\nI wrote about this recently in [Meta Wire](https://metawiredailywire.beehiiv.com/subscribe) (my newsletter) and didn’t expect such split opinions. Some people think we’re focusing on the wrong issue and ignoring blockchain’s actual innovation. Others feel this conversation is critical for the future of the space.\n\nSo what’s your take? Is the energy debate a distraction, or does it genuinely matter for blockchain adoption? Would love to hear what you think.",

This endorsement allows Bitget to legally operate a suite of Bitcoin-related services within the country. These services include the conversion of Bitcoin to fiat currencies, facilitating Bitcoin payments, and providing secure custody for Bitcoin holdings.\n\nThis licensing comes at an opportune time for El Salvador, which has been at the forefront of embracing Bitcoin as a legal tender. The country's financial landscape has been significantly influenced by its cryptocurrency strategy, particularly with its Bitcoin reserves.   \n  \nOn the same day the license was granted, President Nayib Bukele took to the stage to announce a remarkable financial milestone: El Salvador's Bitcoin investments have now generated an unrealized profit of approximately $362 million. This news not only showcases the potential economic benefits of adopting Bitcoin but also underscores the strategic foresight of integrating digital currencies into national finance.\n\nThis development coincides with a celebratory moment for El Salvador, as the nation recognizes the increasing value of its Bitcoin reserves. President Nayib Bukele proudly announced on the same day that El Salvador's Bitcoin investments have accrued an unrealized profit of approximately $362 million.   \n  \nThis financial gain underscores the country's bold move towards integrating Bitcoin into its economic framework, further highlighting the strategic importance of this BSP license for Bitget in expanding its operations within this crypto-friendly jurisdiction.\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/)",

This is what's called the blockchain trilemma.\n\nI did a few internet searches and found the following names floating around when it comes to cryptos that are closer than others to solving the blockchain trilemma:\n\n* Polkadot (DOT)\n* Cosmos (ATOM)\n* Nano (XNO)\n* Algorand (ALGO)\n* Hedera (HBAR)\n\nWhat do you think? Now there could be criteria other than the ability to solve blockchain trilemma that can be used for determining technological superiority, if you think so I'd love to hear about that.\n\nPeople get into crypto to trade and make quick money.

    "selftext": "HoldCoin stands out as a unique Telegram-based crypto asset management simulator game, where the ethos goes beyond mere competition to foster friendship, community, and shared growth. Within this game, players have the opportunity to HOLD various crypto assets, constructing a portfolio that enables them to earn coins through passive income.   \n  \nThe core mechanic is straightforward: the more coins players hold, the greater their passive income, encouraging a strategy of asset accumulation and diversification.  \nHaving attracted over 9 million Web3 users, HoldCoin has not only maintained its appeal within this demographic but has also successfully drawn in a significant number of Web2 users, expanding its reach and influence. This blend of communities has led to an enriching environment where players not only enjoy the game but also gain practical knowledge about managing digital assets.   \n  \nThrough in-game activities like quests and on-chain operations, participants have developed their own Web3 resident IDs, alongside acquiring valuable skills and knowledge.  \nPlatforms like Bitget are tapping into the excitement around HoldCoin by offering incentives such as additional $HOLD for users who engage in specific actions, like depositing HOLDCOIN or locking BTC for an airdrop. These incentives can be particularly alluring in the context of a bull run, where the promise of quick returns is tantalizing.   \n  \nHowever, while these opportunities cater to short-term profit motives, it's equally important for investors to consider the long-term value and sustainability of projects like HoldCoin.  \nThe crypto space is rife with examples like memecoins, which can see meteoric rises due to viral trends on social media but come with significant risks due to their volatility. In contrast, HoldCoin's approach focuses on education and community building, offering a more stable foundation for both new entrants into the crypto world and seasoned investors looking for projects with real utility.   \n  \nThe transition from Web2 to Web3 that HoldCoin facilitates is not just about earning potential but also about learning and community engagement. As players continue to grow their portfolios, they also enhance their understanding of blockchain technology, making HoldCoin a noteworthy project in the broader crypto ecosystem. This dual focus on immediate engagement and long-term education positions HoldCoin uniquely in a market often dominated by short-term speculation.\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/holdcoin/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/holdcoin/)\n\n",

    "selftext": "Looks like i found something interesting that has not beem rampant out there it's mainlly for BTC holders to have a nice time staking.   \n  \nBGBTC introduces a suite of innovative features designed to maximize the potential of your Bitcoin holdings. With effortless staking, you can stake your BTC and enjoy consistent returns while simultaneously earning BGPoints. These points can later be redeemed for token airdrops from a variety of projects, adding an extra layer of benefit to your investment.  \n  \nThe concept of multiple earning opportunities is central to BGBTC, where your Bitcoin not only appreciates in value over time but also participates in token airdrops through strategic partnerships within the BTCFi ecosystem. This essentially turns your Bitcoin into a dynamic income generator, offering avenues for both passive and active income.  \n  \nAn early settlement option provides additional flexibility; you can choose to settle your BGPoints earnings early, based on current market rates, providing liquidity when needed without waiting for the staking period to end.  \n  \nBGBTC also supports flexible trading and earn scenarios, where it can be used in diverse trading environments. Whether it's as collateral for loans or margin in futures trading, BGBTC allows you to diversify your investment strategies, making your Bitcoin work harder for you.  \n  \nThe token's role in ecosystem growth cannot be overstated. By holding BGBTC, you're not just investing in Bitcoin; you're gaining access to participate in Launchpool and PoolX opportunities from various BTCFi projects, directly benefiting from the growth and innovations within this ecosystem.  \n  \nFinally, enhanced security with dual custody underpins the safety of your investment. BGBTC is secured by both Bitget and Cobo, using Multi-Party Computation (MPC) wallets with multi-signature technology. This ensures that your assets are protected with no single point of failure, as no single party can alter or move your transactions unilaterally, offering peace of mind in your investment journey.\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/)",

    "selftext": "I did some digging but couldn’t find any answers related to this hypothetical question.\n\nFrom my research, it clear quantum computers are a long way from cracking the encryption algorithms Bitcoin uses. However, technically if an algorithm existed today, a quantum computer could start mining Bitcoin. I’m guessing that a quantum computer could calculate the target hash much faster than all the traditional computer on the network so the difficulty of the target hash would need to increase to maintain the 10 minute block target.\n\nIf my assumptions about the process above are correct (feel free to correct if I am misunderstanding), I’m curious what would happen to Bitcoin if this quantum computer stopped mining. Would the block creation process come to a halt since the traditional computers remaining on the network would not be able to calculate a hash of such difficulty?",

Maybe they want in on the long-term upside but are too nervous about the large drops and long-tail BTC-to-zero risks. \n\nBasically it is an ETF like IBIT but instead of all the funds going to buy BTC, some small amount of it automatically buys put options at some % drop threshold as a hedge against large drops. The amount spent on the options are rolled into the MER. \n\nFor example there may be a ‘conservative’ variant which has a higher MER but attempts to protect against any drop larger than 20%. This may suit older investors who can’t handle large drops since they need the funds for retirement living so are happy to pay for the ‘insurance’ but still get exposure to large upside. There may be ‘mid-level’ and ‘aggressive’ variants to protect against 40% and 60% drops with progressively lower MER. \n\nI’m sure advanced investors, companies and institutions already do this manually but this would be pre-packaged product for the average investor in their IRA/RRSP. Could be a way to on-board some of the more conservative investors. ",

(yes I'm probably a top signal)\n\nBack in the day inverse perpetual swap contracts that used bitcoin as collateral dominated.

So to be able to trade you have to sit in usdt?? Eww. I suppose you could always have at least a 1x long open to pretend you're holding spot, but now you're paying funding constantly which seems stupid.\n\nAnd my uh, trading partner, ahem... is in the US with a VPN and can't use the places that still have inverse swaps with decent volume like bitmex, binance, bybit, since they're KYC exchanges.\n\nSo... Are there any non kyc exchanges that offer crypto margined perps with half decent volume? Maybe dex's offer a solution?\n\nOr more simply to the end goal, what's the modern approach to trading with the primary focus of increasing your bitcoin stack?",

    "selftext": "Stay with me now, you can join 100 telegram channels and you won't find anything that matches even a little to what you see in kendu inu. Because we do not gamble, we work! Finding high conviction communities is like finding a needle in a haystack. Lucky for you anon, you found the needle.\n\n\n\nThat motto that we don't gamble, we work isn't just something we say - it's something we swear by. What other coin has retracements of over 90% but the activity is the exact same as it was at during ath? I doubt you will ever find a community that matches this, honestly if you can let me know I will be very interesed. These Chad's have dedicated their lives to the Kendu movement and will not take no for an answer.\\\\\n\nI'm serious about the needle in a haystack. Sure some coins with 90% retracements have a few members left, but cannot be compared to the calibre that kendu has. People who were grinding every day at ath are still doing the EXACT same right now, with NO difference. Tell me where you can find people who do this. You literally can't, the kendu army is unmatched anywhere in DeFi. This is why we're going to win, the absolute conviction.\n\nNow that you've found the needle in a haystack what will you do? You could keep gambling on pumpfun or chase the current meta, but let's be real. All those communities are there simply for the price action and will FUD and leave as soon as they're put through any real hardship. Thankfully the Kendu army is battle hardened and knows exactly where we are going. So much so that the movement has extended to in real life shilling. The masses must know about kendu and this is the best way to do it. From energy drinks to jumping out planes to spray painting cars, we have it all with no signs of slowing down. Ask yourself, does your favourite memecoin have a community that is so dedicated they take time out of their busy lives to shill irl? I'd wager probably not.\n\nWith this irl movement, Kendu targets retail better than any other DeFi coin. Sure it might not be a hilarious meme (hawk tuah coin) but was Shiba Inu a funny meme? Retail will see Kendu's irl movement and immediately be hooked and attached, they will then come in and see the work culture we have created and start spreading the word of Kendu. We really are infinitely scalable, it is what it is.\n\n\n\nJust look at these Chad's:  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k823tfaks05e1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0dec7a48a3ebc38265cdce86b47a8b3796e788ef\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/63azxk5ls05e1.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a7a8bdd01bbdaa40815ddaf75fb447bdb1bb77e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/62knezuls05e1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9075bb6bd45d2fb36de117fc0acce19970829e75\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/healykgms05e1.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6bac50280aa86a7f3100f22f09c72d0eb9889e3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/awemqmkvs05e1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54f2320e8951c3d0db67decfb76cd5b9ae8039dd\n\nUse your head anon, do you really think a coin won't succeed after doing all this? Kendu is clearly inevitable and it doesn't take a genius to understand this. Join the movement.

While Bitcoin is highly decentralized, its limitations in scalability and interoperability created opportunities for new developments. Ethereum emerged as the next milestone, addressing some of these issues particularly scalability though not without its own challenges, such as transaction finality issues due to high network congestion.\n\nThis opened the door for Solana, which focused on scaling blockchain technology to new heights. Its high throughput and efficiency fostered a niche for (dApps), even tho Ethereum had pioneered the space.\n\nOver the years, numerous projects have emerged, each tackling the blockchain trilemma of decentralization, scalability, &amp; interoperability. Despite progress, challenges persist such as high gas fees, securing seed phrases, &amp; the complexity of on-chain operations.\n\nThis is where XION comes into play. With its groundbreaking Chain Abstraction Technology (CAT) or Proof of Abstraction (PoA), XION is poised to redefine blockchain usability. By collaborating with Injective to build next-generation Web3 finance applications, XION aims to make blockchain more accessible and user-friendly, even introducing walletless functionality.\n\nSuch innovation could be a paradigm shifter for the DeFi space, esp as its TGE is set for tomorrow at 10:00 UTC on top-tier CEXs \n\nConsidering its use cases &amp; focus on solving disturbing issues in blockchain adoption, XION presents it as a good investment opportunity. With the potential to make significant breakthrough in DeFi and beyond, it's worth paying close attention to this project imho.\n\nhttps://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/xion-2?utm_source=screenshot&amp;utm_medium=app",

    "selftext": "It's been said from the start, Kendu Inu was created to be a multi cycle project. The price action that we are witnessing now for the project is crucial for creating a proper distribution of tokens so that long term growth is achievable. Consider it an opportunity of a lifetime to be able to enter a project as established and committed as Kendu at these levels. Here's a very brief look into the ecosystem if you are not familiar.\n\n**Facts**\n\n* We are the cusp of having 15K holders\n* Kendu is almost 10 months old\n* We rank top 10% in subreddit size\n* We have an NFT platform that is still yet to be fully deployed\n* Kendu is on ETH but will bridge to SOL (and most likely other chains such as BASE)\n* Coinbase Wallet featured Kendu in their advertisement (every other coin featured in the same advert is now listed on Coinbase)\n* We have Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu jewelry, Kendu merch, and much more.\n* We have had several articles written about us in Shib Magazine\n* Kendu Miazaki (dev of Kendu) is going to be speaking at Shibcon about Kendu\n* We hit an ATH of 280M back in June before the bullrun even started\n* We have the best organic community in the space, bar none\n* A juicy fact about kendu, it's the only coin that is backed up with a campaign on okx (the second largest exchange ) [https://www.okx.com/campaigns/kendu-inu](https://www.okx.com/campaigns/kendu-inu)\n* certik 50k votes done and is about to be audited\n* Bitget is partnered with kendu recently\n\nWhy is all of this relevant? I'm sure many of you have seen Bitcoin rise to historic levels these past few weeks, which according to past cycles, marks the start of the \"bullrun\". Right now, it is likely that we will see Bitcoin continue to rise above 100K and dominate the crypto market. Once Bitcoin dominance falls off, we will then see the true Altcoin season begin and with how things have turned out, it's highly likely this bullrun will be massive.\n\nWe are still in the prestages of a full fledged parabolic memecoin season and now is the perfect time to enter projects like Kendu who have firmly established themselves in the space and are entering the late stages of a major retracement phase. Now is not the time to chase green candles, it's the time to accumulate dips and get in on established projects BEFORE they explode; that is if you want to make actual life-changing money this bullrun.\n\nThere is a rising figure in the crypto space that goes by MustStopMurad and I feel what he says will ring even more true when this cycle ends.\n\n\"You are NOT investing in Memes. You are investing in PEOPLE. The Key is to find Communities that have:  \n\\- Inspired people hustling daily  \n\\- 6+ months old  \n\\- Survived multiple large drops  \n\\- Holder Count growing every month  \n\\- $20 Billion+ Target  \n\\- Great Distribution + Diamondhands\"\n\nKendu Inu checks all these boxes and has grown to be the prime example of what it means to be a proper memecoin built to take full advantage of not only this cycle but future cycles as well.\n\nJoin the community and see first hand the dedication and grind we have no matter what the price action looks like. Paper hands will waver, but true chads will be here until the end.\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)\n\n  \n[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu)",

What is your guess for the lowest price during that window? (Price is in US$, and comes from Coinbase.)\n3. You get one guess.\n4. **Guesses must be messaged to me, NOT sent as a reply to this post.**\n5. **Guesses must be in $100 increments, in round $100 amounts (i.e. $99900, $102300, etc.)**\n6. **Included with your guess must be the instruction \"higher\" or \"lower\". If your guess has already been entered, your guess will be moved to the next available slot, higher or lower, based on your instruction. (If you guess $99900, but $99900 is already taken, I will move your guess to the next available slot, based on your \"higher or lower\".)**\n7. Guesses will be accepted until 11 Dec 2024 00:00:00 UTC.\n8. You must submit an actual number, not \"Whatever the open is on 1 Jan\".\n9. I reserve the right to toss your entry if you're a pain in the ass about it or don't follow the rules.\n\nThe person with the closest guess will get their choice of 0.0005 BTC or $50 worth of BTC at the price at the close of the contest. Once all the entries are in, I will post the guesses here. I will include my guess as well.\n\nNote that the increment rule has changed! Your guess needs to end with at least 2 zeros!\n\n**EDIT:  Rule #6 is a rule, not a suggestion!  Include \"higher\" or \"lower\"!**\n\n# THE CONTEST IS CLOSED!",

They have also mentioned in the past through their CEO in a space with our dev, that when we reclaim ATH and the same volume as then, they will happily list us.\n\n[OKX](https://preview.redd.it/osiz43sew64e1.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=233daf841799449fcc7d8667e53a4250c6b2926a)\n\nCurrently running now aswell, we have an OKX campaign that allows users to earn rewards through signing up. There is also other rewards that can be given through this same campaign through trading on the app and giving volume!\n\nso basically through pure hardwork, dedication and old school running it up, the KENDU community has single handedly been noticed by three top exchanges. To be noticed, yet alone have individual campaigns given out purely through the exchanges own desires, is so incredibly bullish it can not be understated. Now, imagine the future of kendu and what listings we might get when we start pulling back to ATH and getting that volume.\n\nA coinbase ad, Bitget giveaway and OKX campaign.\n\nWhat other coins do you see running on an OKX campaign, what other coins with a Bitget giveaway? Kendu is found sitting pretty with the likes of BTC and ETH on the coinbase ad aswell.\n\nThe thing is though, anyone can compete in the Bitget giveaway and OKX campaign! so if you yourself are interested in doing so, get competing! it is a wonderful opportunity for anyone, whether you are already a kendu holder or not, to try and win some goods through signing up for both the OKX campaign and the Bitget giveaway.\n\nFor instructions on Bitget, see this link: [https://x.com/bitgetwallet/status/1862441392041337053](https://l.messenger.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fx.com%2Fbitgetwallet%2Fstatus%2F1862441392041337053&amp;h=AT3mrQzHyCX9qDbegPo1J1uLDww3Jp9fA4-xt9QwOCrVTCow2yFjYrKX9pzq5-BSDatqx5Jx1o_OYszZgk24d5ZMIlVnQ6PGR0pforV6iDHJFBtERHIZxMo_x8VDvONCPN-7_wroy0s)\n\nfor the OKX campaign, sign up here: [https://www.okx.com/campaigns/kendu-inu](https://l.messenger.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.okx.com%2Fcampaigns%2Fkendu-inu&amp;h=AT3mrQzHyCX9qDbegPo1J1uLDww3Jp9fA4-xt9QwOCrVTCow2yFjYrKX9pzq5-BSDatqx5Jx1o_OYszZgk24d5ZMIlVnQ6PGR0pforV6iDHJFBtERHIZxMo_x8VDvONCPN-7_wroy0s)\n\nif gives everyone a chance to win something!\n\nCA: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18\n\nCG: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu)  \ncmc: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)",

It is about hanging on for dear life, through all the dips, through all the noise and not fading at the critical moments.\n\nAn opportunity like SHIB was presented to so many people and yet they faded.\n\nIt is important to look at the current market through an objective scope. Alt season has not yet begun, BTC.D is still peaking, and even now as of writing the market is going through a small correction. Barely any alts are moving, and those FEW that do are through insider trading and cabals. Ultimately, the only way to win in this game is with community.\n\nHere in $KENDU I know we have the best community in DeFi and that is just fact. I also know, the way to win is through work, time and effort.\n\nI know I do not want to be the person who looks back in the future and goes.. \"I faded kendu, i could have had millions\"\n\nBuy the blood, reap the rewards\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i1manmcupx3e1.png?width=474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f9c21289f4f109f67aaf80eca603ac521ff7cd0\n\n# So why $KENDU?\n\nThere is so many things in the future for KENDU. Events - Shibcon, Melbourne Kendu party. Listings such as the largest exchange in India, COINDCX, an OKX campaign that is currently occuring, an NFT platform that will provide passive $ETH to holders of the associated NFTs \"Chads\", along with a propping up of the actual chart through the platforms earnings. A bridging to $SOL via wormhole, and eventually $BASE for the maximum amount of accessibility and reach.\n\nWe have so many things in the future for KENDU, but i feel it is unimportant to focus in these when in front of us we already have the key to our success; the community. Kendu is placing itself in pole position for the upcoming alt season in 2025. We are maximising our output, engagement and work through sheer organic dedication. As a community, we are closing in on the 50 000 certik votes completely organically. Yes, we could have paid for it, why though? We have demonstrated the capacity of how our community can chip away at any monsterous feat.\n\nRight now we are planting crops, we are sewing the fields and working. Showing up every day in every single way. We are out there as a community, IRL shilling, getting IRL branding, doing everything in our output to ensure the success of $KENDU\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfeng5dtpx3e1.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c65897680492dacb99635af44a130f223a8426bf\n\nWe have things such as energy drinks, kendu coffee, jewellery and even protein powder / creatine on the whey. We have chads jumping out of planes, even tattooing their reproduction organs through the name of kendu conviction.\n\nThis community is more than just a coin. It is a movement. A brand. An opportunity to learn from so many experienced OG Shib holders and long time crypto investors. A canvas that so many community members are using to propel their own initiatives forward, using the Kendu canvas as an opportunity to paint their dreams.\n\nWe are running this up even better then Shib did in 2020/21. We are a perpetual, multi-cycle movement. There is no better chance in all of DeFi then here at kendu for 2025 at winning.\n\nSo, will you join the movement anon?\n\n0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18\n\n  \nCMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)\n\nCG: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu)",

This may not happen because Bitcoin has just formed RSI Hidden Bullish Divergence 📈 on the 12H timeframe, signaling that the bottom for this correction is probably in!\n\n🔍 Moving to shorter timeframes:\n • On the 4H Chart, Bitcoin appears to be preparing for a breakout from the symmetrical triangle pattern I mentioned the other day!\n • On the 1H Chart, Bitcoin has already broken out of a triangle pattern! Watch for a retest and keep an eye on those critical support and resistance levels!\n\nStay vigilant and watch the charts closely! 🔥📊 https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin",

    "title": "Let’s talk about Bitcoin price retractions (why they happen and when the next one is coming)",
    "selftext": "The so called “crypto winter” of 2022 shocked many new investors of crypto, but the history of Bitcoin tells us these retractions are quite normal-healthy, even.  They seem to occur approximately a year after Bitcoin hits ATH for that 4 year cycle.  Here are some notable past retractions.\n\n1. December 2013 : Bitcoin = $1000.\nDecember 2014: Bitcoin = $375.(62% drop)\n\n2.December 2017 : Bitcoin = $17,000.\nDecember 2018 : Bitcoin = $3,200.(80% drop)\n\n3.November 2021 : Bitcoin = $64,000.\nNovember 2022: Bitcoin = $16,000.(75% drop)\n\nSo why does this happen?  And will it happen this current cycle?\n\nThe why:\n\nFor each price retraction, you can potentially argue for unique reasons why they occurred.  For example, in 2022 the Federal Reserve raised interest rates 7 times, from nearly 0 to 4.25-4.50%.\n\nBut in general, I believe the reliable timing of these price retractions (admittedly with only 3 data points) signal that they occur due to pure crowd psychology and the fact that demand side buying pressure is difficult to sustain over long periods of time.  Remember that demand typically increases approx. one year prior to halving and at this point in the cycle, increased demand needs to be sustained for nearly 3 continuous years to keep increasing price.\n\nThe factors at ATH are: \n1. Investors begin taking profits.\n2. People who bought near the top due to FOMO (and have little regard for fundamentals) see this correction due to selling pressure and panic sell, fueling further losses.  \n3.  The news cycle starts to report on the “bubble bursting,” often reporting headlines without proper context (“Bitcoin down 35%!” Without stating the time period it was down 35%)\n4. Many investors of Bitcoin are aware of the 4 year cycle.  And while we collectively prepare for the post halving bull run, as price reaches a hypothetical ATH, it’s every man for himself in terms of exit strategy.  You take profits based on your own unique financial situation.  Demand side pressure slowly decreases, and the price trades sideways for months, followed by slow losses but constant losses each month.\n\nConclusion: So will we see another price retraction this cycle?\n\nAnswer:  Most likely, yes.  But it depends on why you believe they occur.  If you believe, as I do, that price retractions are fundamentally due to 2 things-The difficulty in sustaining increased demand side buy pressure over 3 continuous years and basic crowd psychology-\n\nThen, yes, a huge price retraction is coming one year after BTC hits ATH.  If Bitcoin maxes out at 150k in December 2025, history tells us that December 2026 could reveal a Bitcoin price of $50,000 (65% drop.). \n\nIf you believe that each price retraction was unique in nature, then no, there may not be one this cycle.  \n\nCheers!\n\n\n\n",

E.g some of the most wealthy and powerful companies in the world getting involved in Bitcoin like Blackrock, the Cynthia Lummis bill that proposes that the US gov purchase 200,000 bitcoins every year for 5 years. And then there is the other stuff that will be good for the crypto industry more generally, Gensler resigning and being replaced with a more crypto-friendly head, companies like Ripple being unshackled after the court case comes to an end. \n\nThere is a lot of positive things happening right now for crypto and due to happen, but will it really be enough to send the crypto industry soaring and establish it as the 12th sector of the S&amp;P500, like Kevin O’Leary has predicted?",

    "selftext": "It's been said from the start, Kendu Inu was created to be a multi cycle project.  The price action that we are witnessing now for the project is crucial for creating a proper distribution of tokens so that long term growth is achievable.  Consider it an opportunity of a lifetime to be able to enter a project as established and committed as Kendu at these levels.  Here's a very brief look into the ecosystem if you are not familiar.\n\n**Facts**\n\n* We are the cusp of having 15K holders\n* Kendu is almost 10 months old\n* We rank top 10% in subreddit size\n* We have an NFT platform that is still yet to be fully deployed\n* Kendu is on ETH but will bridge to SOL (and most likely other chains such as BASE)\n* Coinbase Wallet featured Kendu in their advertisement (every other coin featured in the same advert is now listed on Coinbase)\n* We have Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu jewelry, Kendu merch, and much more.\n* We have had several articles written about us in Shib Magazine\n* Kendu Miazaki (dev of Kendu) is going to be speaking at Shibcon about Kendu\n* We hit an ATH of 280M back in June before the bullrun even started\n* We have the best organic community in the space, bar none\n\nWhy is all of this relevant?  I'm sure many of you have seen Bitcoin rise to historic levels these past few weeks, which according to past cycles, marks the start of the \"bullrun\".  Right now, it is likely that we will see Bitcoin continue to rise above 100K and dominate the crypto market.  Once Bitcoin dominance falls off, we will then see the true Altcoin season begin and with how things have turned out, it's highly likely this bullrun will be massive.\n\nWe are still in the prestages of a full fledged parabolic memecoin season and now is the perfect time to enter projects like Kendu who have firmly established themselves in the space and are entering the late stages of a major retracement phase.  Now is not the time to chase green candles, it's the time to accumulate dips and get in on established projects BEFORE they explode; that is if you want to make actual life-changing money this bullrun.\n\nThere is a rising figure in the crypto space that goes by MustStopMurad and I feel what he says will ring even more true when this cycle ends.\n\n\"You are NOT investing in Memes. You are investing in PEOPLE. The Key is to find Communities that have:  \n\\- Inspired people hustling daily  \n\\- 6+ months old  \n\\- Survived multiple large drops  \n\\- Holder Count growing every month  \n\\- $20 Billion+ Target  \n\\- Great Distribution + Diamondhands\"\n\nKendu Inu checks all these boxes and has grown to be the prime example of what it means to be a proper memecoin built to take full advantage of not only this cycle but future cycles as well.\n\nJoin the community and see first hand the dedication and grind we have no matter what the price action looks like.  Paper hands will waver, but true chads will be here until the end.\n\nCoingecko: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu)\n\nDexscreener : [https://dexscreener.com/ethereum/0xd9f2a7471d1998c69de5cae6df5d3f070f01df9f](https://dexscreener.com/ethereum/0xd9f2a7471d1998c69de5cae6df5d3f070f01df9f)\n\nWebsite: [https://www.kenduinu.com/](https://www.kenduinu.com/)\n\nCA: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18",

    "title": "A look back at the BoA Multiplier calculation",
    "selftext": "Some time ago, I got interested in the Bank of America calculation of the multiplier. Many people assumed that knowing the multiplier would enable you to calculate a future price by simple multiplication of the net amount of dollars invested. [ I posted a calculation showing that using their multiplier was not so simple](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/194358b/price_estimates_using_the_boa_multiplier/), and the price goes as the square root of the total dollars invested.\n\nSo as we approach $100K/btc, I was curious how things have played out over nearly a year.  I am going to assume that the total dollars locked into bitcoin for the multiplier is equal to the total ETF investment given [here](https://farside.co.uk/btc/) ($30.8B).  Also, I'm going to add in the total MSTR investment as given [here](https://mstr-tracker.com/) ($16.5B), and since I don't have the full MSTR ownership history, we're going to assume it all happened this year, which is an overestimate, but since my total investment is ETF+MSTR only, hopefully the overestimate captures some of the other investment that is being ignored.\n\nWith those (somewhat crappy) assumptions, and using the BoA multiplier value of 135, **the price predicted is $147K per bitcoin**.\n\nOK, that's pretty far off. What could contribute to the error?\n\n1. My overestimate of MSTR ownership happening all in the current year\n2. The multiplier as calculated by BoA is too high\n3. TheRe ARe EvIL mAnIpUlaTORs KEePING ThE PriCE DoWn!!1!\n\nMy best guess is reason 2, so I can turn around the calculation and use a current price of $97K and **solve for the multiplier instead. which turns out to be close to 50 at a price of $47K.**\n\nI found it to be an interesting way of looking at price prediction in any case, and I have to wonder what price discovery is going to look like above $100K because I find it difficult to believe that BoA's multiplier is going continue to make any sense if the price accelerates higher.\n\nEdit: To /u/[FreshMistletoe](https://www.reddit.com/user/FreshMistletoe/) point below, there's another way to look at it. Assuming that the multiplier is indeed 135, then another implication is that the total locked-up investment into bitcoin has increased by only $17B, implying that there has been about $30B of sales from lettuce-hands.

    "selftext": "I made a spreadsheet with the closing prices of BTC every day since 1/1/2018 to perform some analysis on the data. Mostly for fun, because predicting how the market goes is a complete gamble, but I found my results an interesting find. Maybe others will point out the flaws or maybe it's more interesting than I think 🤷🏻 but wanted to share it for discussion. \n\nIn my analysis, I determined which day of the week was most likely to have BTC price rise and which would most likely fall. Of the 2,518 data points (days), here are the numbers I have (#rise/#fall): \n\nMonday (181/185)\n\nTuesday (190/176)\n\nWednesday (198/167)\n\nThursday (170/195)\n\nFriday (191/174)\n\nSaturday (207/158)\n\nSunday (196/169)\n\nUsing this data, I determined the probabilities of rise/fall for each day of the week to find which days are most likely to rise/fall, here are those results in order of most likely to rise: \n\nSaturday (56.71%) - best day\n\nWednesday (54.25%)\n\nSunday (53.70%)\n\nFriday (52.33%)\n\nTuesday (51.91%)\n\nMonday (49.45%)\n\nThursday (46.58%) - worst day \n\nMy personal results of this analysis: I started trading BTC 3 weeks ago. By day trading with $150, I've earned about $16 (with fees accounted for) and paid about $20 in trading fees. Whereas if I kept the SATS I bought originally, they'd have gained about $49 in value. Therefore, my ultimate takeaway is that day trading offers a way to keep the money in circulation, possibly the ability to keep money safer from the market drops, but in the end also shields you from potential long term gains as well.\n\nI wanted to perform this analysis to compare potential of day trading to long term investments and out of curiosity. My takeaway is that weekends are generally great for price increases, and generally price will dip before and after the weekend. That said, statistics can be bullshit and there could be any number of other factors haha but I thought it was interesting nonetheless. Thoughts?\n\nEdit: had Friday in the wrong place in my final list lol",

    "title": "It's Always a Good Time to Invest",
    "selftext": "I’ll admit, I was skeptical about Bitcoin at first. It sounded too abstract, too volatile, and honestly, too good to be true. But over the years, as I’ve watched the financial world evolve and crumble in certain areas, I’ve come to realize something: it’s never a bad time to buy Bitcoin. Let me explain why.\n\nBitcoin is more than just a digital coin; it’s a hedge. Against inflation, against the instability of traditional markets, against the uncertainties of a centralized financial system that can be manipulated. While governments print money endlessly, eroding the value of every dollar I save, Bitcoin operates on a fixed supply. Only 21 million will ever exist, period. There’s no quantitative easing, no bailouts, no central authority pulling strings. It’s a foundation built on scarcity and trust in the code.\n\nThen there’s the growing adoption. I’ve seen major companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, countries experimenting with making it legal tender, and even my tech-savvy friends starting to take it seriously. These aren’t random trends—they’re signals of a paradigm shift. Every day, Bitcoin inches closer to mainstream acceptance, and I want to be ahead of that curve.\n\nPeople always say, “But it’s so volatile!” Sure, it can spike or crash in the short term, but zoom out. Look at its history. Over the years, the trend is clear: upward. It’s like planting a tree; you don’t panic over a windy day if you know that tree will bear fruit for decades. The dips? I see them as buying opportunities, not setbacks.\n\nWhat really gets me, though, is the freedom Bitcoin offers. It’s mine—completely. No bank can freeze it, no government can seize it. I’ve always wanted my money to be just that: mine. Bitcoin gives me that autonomy, and there’s a certain power in knowing I’m part of a decentralized network that transcends borders, time zones, and middlemen.\n\nSo yeah, Bitcoin isn’t just an investment to me—it’s a belief in a better way. Whether prices are high, low, or somewhere in between, I’ve realized that buying in is never a bad decision. It’s a vote for financial independence, for innovation, and for a future that I’m proud to be a part of.\n\n",

This meticulous documentation affords me a substantial analytical edge in understanding market trends.  \n  \nBased on my daily analysis, it appears that the predominant factor currently influencing Bitcoin's price trajectory is linked to political events, notably the anticipation of a Trump victory. There are also indications from U.S. government discussions about strategic shifts in economic policy, suggesting divestment from gold to potentially invest in Bitcoin, which could significantly alter market dynamics.  \n  \nIn light of these developments, I will be executing my trading strategies on the Bitget platform, where I aim to benefit from their promotional event offering a 250k DOGE airdrop. This approach not only aligns with my analysis but also positions us favorably within the current market conditions.  \n  \nGiven this backdrop, my recommendation remains to retain our Bitcoin holdings. By doing so, we are not just participating in the market; we are positioning ourselves for potential long-term prosperity in an evolving financial landscape.\n\nif you wanna participate in the Diamond thursday event : [DOGE event ](https://www.bitget.com/events/activities/b49053b0b31c5db3b76309eac01d89e3?color=black)\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p1s0v3k5r22e1.jpg?width=1952&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0fafef6872705aec55d1a89c2d2fb6bd72d1248c\n\n",

So this means that there is a temporary fork of bitcoin right? Someone might have received one version before the other and this will result in a temporary fork resolved when the next block is mined(?).\n\nSo if there is a fork there is also the eventuality of double spending I guess(?) let's suppose that there are two ecommerce (A and B) accepting bitcoin and they are connected to the btc network, the ecommerce A gets the X version of the fork and ecommerce B gets the Y version of the fork, so I can spend the same coin on both ecommerce because they have different versions of the blockchain right?\n\nHowever this only lasts until a new block is resolved, and thus all forks are nullified by the new blockchain which has more computational work.\n\nDid I get something wrong, and in case what and why?\n\nThanks",

One example is that bitcoin needs too much computing power to actually make a transaction without a central bank or government.\nSo, I came to this community to ask what cryptocurrency fixed bitcoin's many problems so that it is the most suited to be actually used as a real-world decentralized currency.",

Bitcoin in 2024 is very different from 2010, 2013, or 2017.\n\nWhile cycles will continue, their timing and magnitude aren't predictable because the underlying dynamics keep evolving. \n\nI do have two predictions:\n\n1. Cycle timing will compress due to accelerating change\n\n2. Amplitude becomes unpredictable as we shift from speculation-driven to adoption-driven network effects. Expect a \"super cycle\" when Bitcoin enters mainstream - marked by infrastructural shifts like banks offering Bitcoin-denominated accounts.",

    "title": "Kaspa (KAS) 🦾: Redefining Blockchain Through High-Speed Block Production",
    "selftext": "Kaspa is a Layer 1 blockchain that sets itself apart with a unique technology known as blockDAG (Directed Acyclic Graph). Traditional blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, follow a linear structure where one block follows the next. Kaspa, however, employs a blockDAG, allowing multiple blocks to be generated and confirmed simultaneously, which significantly increases throughput and lowers confirmation times. In practical terms, this means Kaspa can handle a much higher number of transactions per second compared to traditional blockchain designs, positioning it as a highly scalable solution for a variety of use cases.\nIn the world of Layer 1 blockchains, scalability is a recurring challenge. Many networks struggle to balance speed, decentralization, and security—a problem known as the blockchain trilemma. Kaspa’s approach is groundbreaking because it essentially bypasses this trilemma by creating a network where transaction speed and decentralization do not come at the expense of security. With the potential to produce 10 blocks per second, Kaspa has one of the fastest block production rates in the industry, making it suitable for high-frequency applications such as decentralized exchanges, gaming, and financial transactions.\nKaspa’s recent performance on the charts shows a corrective wave pattern, suggesting it may currently be undergoing a short-term retracement. This could be a buying opportunity for long-term investors, especially if Kaspa finds support at key Fibonacci retracement levels around $0.066 and $0.08. The price is also approaching a critical area on its exponential moving average (EMA), which has historically provided a strong support base during downturns. While it’s experiencing a consolidation phase, Kaspa’s fundamentals remain robust, and its unique technology positions it as a potential leader in blockchain scalability.\n\n🚀✨🦎 https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kaspa?utm_source=screenshot&amp;utm_medium=app\n\n",

It also highlighted the need for user-friendly platforms that simplify complex processes.\n\nA New Dawn: AlienX\n\nFortunately, I stumbled upon AlienX, a platform that seems to address the shortcomings I encountered with EigenLayer. Its AI-powered optimization promises to maximize staking rewards, while its diverse asset support and robust security infrastructure provide peace of mind.\n\nThe AI Revolution in Staking\n\nAI has the potential to revolutionize the staking landscape. By automating processes, optimizing rewards, and enhancing security, AI-powered platforms like AlienX can offer significant advantages to users.\n\nAlienX has recently Got listed on Bitget, a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, to launch a staking pool for BTC. This collaboration offers users the opportunity to earn attractive rewards while contributing to the security of the ecosystem\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the role of AI in the future of staking?\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/alienx/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/alienx/)",

    "selftext": "We reached all-time high before the halving then piddled around for seven months after. Why? I’ve got reasons. Butt-pulled reasons, but they are reasons. \n\nThis assumes halvings mean something. It also assumes exogenous factors like the 2020 money printing bonanza, 2021 China mining ban, and 2024 ETF approval affect the price as well. \n\nThe 2020 halving happened on 5/11/20. Bitcoin reached a new all time high 219 days later on 12/16/20. It then continued upward until the China ban. \n\nIn 2024, the Bitcoin price was $42,853 on the day the ETFs launched. It piddled around for a bit then rocketed into the fifth dimension in February going past ATH before the halving. **This was because of the ETFs**. THEN, that ran out of steam. It stopped propelling the price into the stratosphere. \n\nThe price fell and rose and fell and rose and piddled around prompting people to declare the #58KGang. The ETFs were enough to keep it above the level it should have been without the ETFs, but they weren’t powerful enough to rocket it anymore. If there were no ETFs, Bitcoin would have gradually gone from $42,853 to \\~$64K today with normal Bitcoin variance. \n\nIt’s now 183 days after the 2024 halving. It will be 219 days on 11/24/24. We can expect choppiness until approximately then at which point Bitcoin will resume its upward trajectory. \n\nOr the hypothesis is malarkey. I said it was butt-pulled. But it did occur to me.",

    "title": "2x leverage swing trading scenario: good for fiat gains but diminishing returns for reinvesting in underlying asset?",
    "selftext": "I am looking into using leverage for swing trading. I am still new to this and won't consider actually leverage trading before I better understand it, don't worry.\n\nHere's a scenario. I hold 1 BTC and I will use 2x leverage (which is the maximum I am comfortable with for swing trading given its corresponding liquidation price). To simplify I won't include fees in my calculations. I close out the trade after each theoretical price increase and use the profits to buy BTC.\n\nScenario 1: BTC doubles in price, and I will have 1.5 BTC instead of 1 BTC (if I just held my BTC).  \nScenario 2: BTC triples in price, and I will have 1.66 BTC instead of 1 BTC.  \nScenario 3: BTC quadruples in price, and I will have 1.75 BTC instead of 1 BTC.  \nMeanwhile, in fiat terms I will have made 1, 2 or 3 times (in scenarios 1 to 3, respectively) my inital btc investment (in USD) in profits. But I do not want fiat, I want Bitcoin. so for accumulating Bitcoin it is markedly less interesting than for making fiat gains. So it would make sense for me to only use this strategy if I invest the profits in something else than the underlying asset, like the stock market for instance.\n\nI am all-in on crypto and it would be good for me to diversify by investing in the stock market. In this case I think 2x leverage swing trading would be attractive, trying to exit at 2-3x current market price. But it is a lot less attractive reinvesting the profits into the underlying asset, BTC, given the diminishing returns.  \nPlease let me know if my analysis has been sound thus or if I am missing something. I would not be comfortable increasing my liquidation price as the BTC price goes up.\n\n\n\nEdit: the more I think about it, the more answers I think I am getting. Diminishing returns doesn't have to be a problem as long as Bitcoin outpaces, say the stock market, by roughly 2.5x (quick math). Given year on year historical growth records one would predict it will outpace the stock market by a far greater ratio so, actually, investing the leverage trade gains into Bitcoin will still be better than investing it into an asset like stocks.\n\nEdit 2 months later, probably no one will read this but just in case: do your due diligence. There was a lot I didn't know about and still don't. I haven't used leverage and discovered more drawbacks such as rebalancing. Leverage is for short term and people who know what they are doing. Futures I can't trade where I live. ",

    "selftext": "I have been baffled at the fact that financial institutions have been buying more bitcoin each day that the amount is created by the miners without affecting the price much. Bitcoin did reach a new all-time high for a day or so at the time the ETFs were approved in the US, and since then bitcoin's price has stabilized at around $60,000.\n\n\n\nAlso, the charts I have seen that show how the amount of bitcoin in cryptocurrency exchanges keeps decreasing are misleading. The y axis on these graphs stop at the lowest amount of bitcoin available. If the y axis stopped at zero it would indicate more clearly how much the amount is decreasing and how long will it be until exchanges run out of bitcoin. So I asked ChatGPT to give me an estimate. Here it is below.\n\n\n\nRemember that the price of bitcoin can skyrocket at any time for a variety of reasons.

    "title": "$XDEFI Holders Commit to 1-Year Liquidity Lock, Signaling Confidence in Ctrl Wallet",
    "selftext": "According to [this report from NewsBTC](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/xdefi-holders-commit-to-1-year-liquidity-lock-signaling-confidence-in-ctrl-wallet/) $XDEFI is completing a rebrand to $CTRL with a generous liquidity locking program. Here are the most interesting details:\n\n\n**Liquidity Boost &amp; Stakeholder Commitment**: Ctrl Wallet is launching a 12-month liquidity provision program for its $XDEFI token, with major holders (including Delphi Digital, Mechanism Capital, and others) committing 32% of the total $XDEFI supply to Uniswap pools. This shows long-term confidence in the project while deepening liquidity and reducing selling pressure.\n\n\n\n**Tokenomics Overhaul**: The project is introducing a new token unlocking schedule tied to performance milestones, starting in March 2025. Tokens will unlock at different stages of the $XDEFI token reaching $100M, $200M, $300M, and $500M fully diluted valuations.\n\n\n\n**Incentivized Liquidity**: Investors locking their tokens in AMM pools will earn a 10% APY on their deposits, but the treasury’s tokens are excluded from this benefit, aligning rewards with external contributors.\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?\n\n\nCoingecko listing: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/xdefi",

    "title": "PTLCs: The Standard(?)",
    "selftext": "One major advantage of PTLCs over HTLCs for atomic swaps is that there is no direct on-chain linkage of paired PTLCs. However, as with anything related to privacy, heuristics and correlation of metadata such as timing can link txs with high degree of confidence. The privacy of a single PTLC thus depends on the existence of other PTLCs; the greater the anonymity set the better.\n\nHere are some ideas, used together, to get full advantage of PTLCs.  \n(For the sake of this discussion, we will assume that the increased plasma requirements are not a problem.)\n\n1. Externally, only use standard sends when the desired outcome is a public payment between two known addresses. Internally, only use standard sends for organizing funds between accounts that are already correlated.\n2. If seeking to create a new on-chain identity, when sending funds to a new address, always use a PTLC. This is only effective when other metadata is not correlated. Need to have wallet features to disable auto-receiving, and to help the user collect rewards at different times. Random pillar delegation selection. With a big enough anonymity set, this is much better than say sending to a Cex and withdrawing.\n3. When sending funds to other users, send PTLCs to each other. This is similar to Bitcoin’s concept of coinjoins. If you want to send a user 5 ZNN, instead create a PTLC sending them 10 ZNN, and they will create a PTLC sending you 5. These are actually more private than coinjoins because all ptlcs contribute to the anon set of all other ptlcs within a certain timespan.\n4. Add randomness by default to timing parameters to prevent correlation.\n5. Prefer disposable BIP340 point types even for ZTS-ZTS swaps, to increase the anonyminity set of cross chain swaps with btc.\n6. I might refactor the PTLC embedded to have an account model where PTLCs can be created and unlocked within the embedded contract without needing to withdraw to a zenon address. This can enable high plasma accounts to better take advantage of the proxy unlock feature and greatly increase the number of PTLCs for greater anonymity set.\n\n[Source](https://forum.hypercore.one/t/ptlcs-the-standard/200)\n\n**In the light of these discussions, a “use case” repo was recently published on this topic** by a community developer [CryptoFish](https://github.com/KingGorrin) from r/Zenon_Network \n\nRepo: [https://github.com/KingGorrin/znn\\_ptlc\\_use\\_cases\\_go](https://github.com/KingGorrin/znn_ptlc_use_cases_go)\n\nPublications are open source and open to new developments and discussions.\n\n\n\n",

Ripley, a University of Illinois alum, has been involved in crypto since 2013. He emphasized two key messages:\n\n**David Ripley** - CEO of *Kraken* UIUC alum been in crypto since 2013.\n\nHis two messages were\n\n1)The U.S. is falling behind in crypto innovation and is no longer a leader in the space.\n\n2) Innovation is crucial for both business growth and development.He believes the cycles are becoming more muted, (not as drastic highs and lows)\n\nRipley noted that crypto cycles are becoming more muted (less drastic in highs and lows). He highlighted that this year, over 50% of hedge funds have some exposure to the Bitcoin ETF, although their crypto allocations remain small. He anticipates more adoption within the next two years, especially from pension and sovereign funds. Kraken is focused on attracting more institutional and retail investors as they expand their global presence. He also sees the Middle East gradually entering the crypto space and expects another situation like FTX could occur.\n\n**Salman Khan, CFO of Marathon Digital (a global Bitcoin miner)**\n\nKhan discussed the backlog of large utility-scale projects expected to power data centers and noted increased interest from institutional investors. He predicted that energy harvesting businesses will replace traditional utility-scale Bitcoin mining within the next 4-8 years. Currently, they heat 11,000 homes in Finland through Bitcoin mining.\n\n**Amy Oldenborg, Head of Emerging Markets at Morgan Stanley:**\n\nOldenborg advised reading the fine print regarding Morgan Stanley's recent announcement allowing registered clients to offer Bitcoin ETFs. This offering is only for taxable brokerage accounts, which represents a small part of their business but is still a significant first step.\n\n**Joseph Chalom, Managing Director at BlackRock:**\n\nChalom is part of BlackRock’s small digital asset team and helped grow and scale the Aladdin platform. He emphasized that client demand drives everything they do. While not everyone is interested, BlackRock aims to offer crypto services in safe ways for those who are. He mentioned that clients are interested in tokenizing various assets, including buildings and income streams. Chalom also pointed out the need for a regulator-accepted digital identity solution and stressed BlackRock’s responsibility to educate the industry on crypto.\n\n**Jenny Johnson, CEO of Franklin Templeton ($1.6 trillion asset manager):**\n\nJohnson is the third-generation leader of Franklin Templeton, which her grandfather founded. They have tokenized a money market fund, participate in staking, and have a venture capital fund investing in the crypto space. She predicts that ETFs will eventually be tokenized. Johnson’s main focus is on blockchain and AI as disruptive technologies and emerging trends.",

    "title": "Introducing CATDOG: The Meme Token Bridging the Divide on the Solana Blockchain",
    "selftext": "\n1. CATDOG is a unique meme token on the Solana blockchain that blends the beloved imagery of both cats and dogs into one playful concept.\n\n2. The age-old debate between cat and dog lovers has found its way into the crypto world, creating a light-hearted divide among meme coin enthusiasts.\n\n3. Enter $CATDOG—the token designed to unite both sides. By merging the charm of cats and dogs, $CATDOG aims to put an end to this friendly rivalry and foster a strong, united community.\n\n4. Whether you're a feline aficionado or a canine enthusiast, $CATDOG offers the best of both worlds. Join us in bridging the gap and creating a harmonious future in crypto. It's time to end the cat vs. dog war once and for all with $CATDOG.\n\nHighlights\n\n- Riding the Market Trend, Breaking Conventional Meme Aesthetics: CATDOG stands out in the Solana blockchain's meme sector, known for generating significant wealth. The concept of \"cat and dog in one body\" is rare, giving CATDOG an innate appeal that naturally attracts market attention and funds.\n\n- High On-Chain Activity: Over the past 24 hours, CATDOG has seen nearly $5 million in trading volume across more than 15,000 transactions. The daily candlestick chart indicates a favorable trend, reflecting strong market interest.\n\n- Strong Community and Social Media Presence: CATDOG's community is highly engaged, particularly in English-speaking regions. The project has been promoted by several prominent English-speaking crypto influencers, suggesting significant growth potential in non-English-speaking markets like China.\n\n- Listed on Bitget on August 9th at 11:00 (UTC): With the broader market on the upswing, meme tokens like CATDOG are well worth watching. Bitget is also hosting a community giveaway and a poolX event where users can mine CATDOG by staking BTC.\n\n- Bullish Price Action: The project’s price action suggests the potential for further upside, supported by a visible upward trend in the chart.\n\n- Growing Momentum: The momentum depicted by recent candlesticks indicates that investors might witness further price expansion of the CATDOG token in the coming weeks.\n\n- Increased Exposure Through Bitget Listing: The listing on Bitget will further boost CATDOG's exposure, potentially driving the price up as more investors take notice.\n\nhttps://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cat-dog",

Price got so close to the box though ...that I have been debating calling it a hit.\n\nWhy this matters is that if then 3rd touch of the big trend line running from the peak is triggered on it's 3rd touch it will be FAR easier to break.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3dnojbhddehd1.png?width=1428&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6935af31ff81c2c11ecad79a14fc046615d7d39\n\nNow I typically chart in market share view on DEX screener v USD however you can also chart on price view also versus CRO. This gives us 4 slightly different charts. By slighty different I mean price will be 2-3% off.

    "selftext": "One day ago KENDU was sitting between 121-108 million MC give or take. This was after an already bloody weekend, but then we had a wild morning with BTC dipping below 50K. KENDU dipped all the way to 77 million MC. \n\nCurrently sitting at 100 million MC and I have no idea if this will be the end (BTC found a bottom and reaccumulation starts), but it doesn't matter to the KENDU community. We have recovered well and there is a lot to be really positive about. ****\nAt time of writing:\n-Buys to sells ratio, 2.69:1 (bullish😉)\n-buyer to seller ration, 2.84:1 (also bullish)\n-JaredFromSubway is back doing his thing (not confirmed, but I am fairly certain that is his wallet and he really LOVES Kendu)\n-MC is down under 10% only in 48 hours\n-still the holder count is growing (13613 holders on DEXs)\n-Volume is 3.5 million\n-Kendu Chads have 3,616/10K NFTs minted (for me the NFT is a means to passive income from the KENDU brand NFT marketplace which goes live after the mint is complete)\n-big whale buys happening (10 ETH 10:41am EST) as the appetite for KENDU never stopped\n\nOut of the Telegram for just over 4 hours and\n-1417 messages in the main Kendu Inu Ecosystem Telegram\n-at least 5 Reddit posts I found and countless KENDU comments (what I found in a shortish check)\nTHE KENDU army is everywhere sharing this opportunity. I have no doubt we have been working on other socials too probably ones other coins don't even use! We aren't going anywhere.\n\n**My point is that KENDU is a brand, a lifestyle choice that people have committed to in order to run it back like SHIB did, sights set on multi-billions.** We are working to be everywhere and won't let massive market moves stop us. This is bred into our culture and woven into the fabric of the KENDU ethos. Billions and billions in liquidations, people losing their positions and selling, a huge shake up has happened and no matter if it is over or we have more time with more blood, Kendu has the army to endure and to march forward to our goals. \n\nPeole know about KENDU and clearly have a large appetite for KENDU. This is not financial advice to buy, this is a call to come check out what you are missing!\n\n*Financial advice* Stop messing around with live pairs and pump.rugpull new memecoins. Get off some shitty Jeet chain coin and stop gambling. Many of these coins can't come back from this type of move and you get rekt (all your money is gone). This or very very soon is potentially the last chance to find your horse for the real bull market race and stick with it. You have a chance to change your financial standing if you find something that is a proven winner. \n\nFor me, that winner is Kendu and I sleep well at night knowing I am part of the KENDU Army.\n\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/",

    "selftext": "**Red Seas**\n\nThe market is struggling, Bitcoin is under 59,000, ETH is under 2,800, it is a sea of red.  Times of fear provide the perfect opportunity for investors to invest in projects at excellent prices.  It is the time to finally take advantage of the market and set yourself up for great success when the market inevitably goes green again.  The only problem is, when the entire market is in the red, how do you decide what project is worth investing in?  None of the charts will look good, so it's vital to pay attention to the conviction that community members have for their project during these bearish times.\n\nThe Kendu Inu community has been built on the ethos that you as an individual can only control what you can control and there is no reason to waste your time and energy worrying about things that are out of your control.  Simple concept, but it has such a substantial impact on the strength and resilience of a memecoin project.\n\nAt Kendu Inu, \"we don't gamble, we work\".\n\nThis slogan is the reason the community never stops working, regardless of the shitshow that is happening around us.  We know that our work will pay off eventually, so we continue to work whether the market is booming or busting.  We can control our own destiny through our own actions.  This conviction and dedication doesn't just exist for no reason, there are many reasons why the community believes that Kendu will succeed.\n\n**The Shib/Shytoshi and Kendu Inu connections**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9mfetinxfpgd1.jpg?width=643&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94986219a22977070e0e6439b87e19327d410472\n\nShytoshi Kusama, the lead developer for Shib, has followed Kendu Inu since it was just under 300 members and has even gone as far as entering the telegram and saying he supports the project.  This was proven by the fact that Kendu has appeared in the Shib magazine several times now and the project even had an AMA event with Shib community leader Xanders Shib.  Most recently, Shytoshi Kusama yet again showed his support for the Kendu Inu ecosystem by reposting a post from the main Kendu Inu X account.  This Shib connection just continues to get stronger and stronger and it will blow everyone's mind when Kendu is integrated officially into the Shib Ecosystem.\n\n**You want utility? You got it**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ofz0whhyfpgd1.png?width=1883&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38f6aee74aef98ba5e9920bf57893c8bb22a8b9d\n\nRecently the Kendu Inu ecosystem released Kendu Chads, which is an NFT trading platform which will rival the biggest players in the game once Kendu inevitably reaches those multibillion marketcap levels.  Phase 1 is still underway where you can purchase KenduChads NFTs (which essentially act as shares of the platform) and collect ETH trading fees later on when the platform becomes open to public trading of NFTs.  We're talking about a way to passively earn ETH.  over 3500 out of the 10000 chads have already been minted and minting only became live 3 days ago.  This is just one of the extensions of the Kendu Inu ecosystem which will help us reach different audiences and broaden the overall appeal of the project.\n\n**Community commitment (from the whales to the shrimp)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ivrmmb4gpgd1.jpg?width=576&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8563503e78e01e511ca38a25509fc26a1f8cabca\n\nIn order to solidify Kendu's position in the CEX market, one of the admins organized a community driven crowdfunding event.  Over $100,000 was raised initially by every level of Kendu Holder.  We all have full conviction for this project, so donating money to the cause was never an issue.  What was really exciting to see as a member of the community was one of the top holders of Kendu donating over $120,000 dollars to the crowdfund to push us over the initial goal of the initiative.  When I say that every member of the Kendu community has conviction for this project, I mean it.  It does not matter if you have the smallest bag of Kendu or the largest,  we all work for this project to succeed.\n\n**Now is the time**\n\nIt's time to take advantage of this fearful market and load up your bags on the strongest conviction plays you can find.  Kendu is a must have in your portfolio and will no doubt be one of, if not the biggest, memecoins of 2024/2025.  Be warned however, once you fully dive into this project, you'll find yourself wanting to rotate all of your portfolio into Kendu.\n\nCome join the subreddit or take a visit to the new website to become more familiar with the project and find out why this could be your main conviction play for this cycle.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu\\_Ecosystem/](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/)\n\n[https://www.kenduinu.com](https://www.kenduinu.com)\n\n[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu)\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)",

    "selftext": "I have been in crypto since 2017. I made plenty of mistakes (round tripping coins, twice) and missed plenty of opportunities. One thing I was smart enough to avoid was memecoins, but that changed, April of 2024. \n\nI finally had a plan and had followed it with BTC and was waiting on my rebuy/next move. This plan came from years of watching videos and learning about crypto, in particular the BTC cycles. My crypto/meme arc is fascinating as I got rugged for one SOL- on my second meme- because I had IRL stuff going on for 90 minutes after token launch and figured I should be good. Best loss ever as it motivated myself to research and learn about the scum bag swamp of memecoins. I dug into reddit and followed the poster history/profile uncovering the whole aspect of paid services and paid upvotes to drive traffic. I might have gotten a little intense as I invited one of the posters offering paid services into a Telegram chat (I am not including the screenshots of those again) to learn even more. One funny thing is this human seemed to think I wanted money or something.\n\n\n\nWhen that learning and research ended is when I got introduced to KENDU. I was in a Telegram with some of the ‘victims’ and one of them suggested Kendu. I put victims in quotes because so many people are desperate for a quick buck while another portion of people just enjoy gambling. I do not in this regard. The casino is always open and someone is always waiting to steal your money. Trust me for 99% of us the house always wins, but  Kendu is the anti casino and a safe bet that allows me to sleep at night. \n\n\n\nOne thing that attracted me to Kendu is the ethos highlighted the lessons I had learned about investing while at the same time reinforcing the values I picked up in my crypto/meme arc (Don't pay for anything, pic a horse and stick with it, stick to the plan, etc.), BUT the concept of working for my bag was revolutionary to me. Feeling like I have some power in this was a liberating feeling that I have really taken to.\n\n\n\nIt wasn't long after finishing more research on KENDU, asking questions, and listening to everything I could that I pivoted my plan to center it around KENDU. I haven't looked back and love the community and work I have put in! If you want a deep dive into the community here is what I posted a couple days ago best way is to come in the TG and see it for yourself): https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu\\_Ecosystem/comments/1eeq1v2/kendu\\_community\\_updated\\_info\\_journal/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web3x&amp;utm\\_name=web3xcss&amp;utm\\_term=1&amp;utm\\_content=share\\_button\n\n\n\nWith less than 24 hours to the Kendu Chads timer hitting zero and presumably the release of said dApp, this is a really cool moment for me. I have been called a bot and all types of scam-centric words, but this release will be my affirmation of a choice well made. I don’t know if the price will go up or down, but it doesn’t matter as this feature seems guaranteed to provide some real Utility in ‘earning cold hard ETH’ and it means I didn’t larp for upvotes or to increase my karma. I researched and listened and learned and I was correct to trust what I found and what I believed. I also know that the community will keep working and that Miazaki is built very different. He has said many things in the Spaces and they are all very real and come to fruition. It is not too late to do research and check out our Telegram. This cycle will heat up again for the real bull run and Kendu is already primed to take full advantage of that with the first aspect of the Ecosystem releasing and a ravenous and hard working community tearing up socials everyday. I believe everyone should have some exposure (hopefully to the tune of 5 million Kendu) to Kendu, but this isn’t financial advice. This is a call to do your own research! This is my real reddit account and will still be my real account when this crypto cycle is over.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mzxannm7dvfd1.png?width=2304&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d94d67218003b7335f5519f3244da2caab94252\n\nTLDR: I have stayed in Kendu (on ETH…happy belated birthday) because of the community, OG developer experience and skill, vast connections, potential, road map (Ecosystem not a memecoin with a glass ceiling to its potential), and dare I say fun.\n\n  \n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)\n\n",

    "title": "KENDU Community Updated Info Journal",
    "selftext": "Here is a updated deep dive into a specific aspect about $KENDU , a meme built with a plan around a strong dev with experience and vision. THIS IS NFA, but merely sharing of my perspective on this project. I have been in the crypto space since 2017 and as of about 13 weeks ago I had avoided touching memes altogether. I had a plan, but it all got derailed when I kept digging and reading and looking at KENDU. Yes, I have a bag, but that doesn't mean I am trying to tell you to buy. I merely want to provide an avenue for you to see the facts and come to your own financial choice.\n\n**Point: $KENDU is backed by a super strong community who create an infectious culture built around work and acceptance.** Take a look at the data below:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t8d8mkf8qdfd1.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9254872b34d2101e2838699aa97dc7308daaced0\n\nKendu is constantly attracting new holders on DEXs (decentralized exchanges) and as far as I understand it, I am not able or capable of tracking how many holders we have on the 14 CEXs we are listed on. One of the reasons is that we are everywhere and people are using their skills to bring awareness about Kendu.\n\nOne Chad made an amazing Kendu Pendant:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ibl012d9qdfd1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a15e4b557d2042c60fed1f322e6701d1001e279\n\nPeople have been printing their own stickers and placing them anywhere and every to raise awareness:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/coe4tm8aqdfd1.jpg?width=3072&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=498c88bbf226b828f3b9e8e35d10d30649f0ba9a\n\nWe had people in NYC filming the billboard that was paid for by a very famous member of our community. Also people hanging flyers in cities from Boston to NYC to Australia.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cukrj18bqdfd1.png?width=1076&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a86f2b0df3f9c447dad1759c945a744d6add0e5d\n\nAnother member was promoting Kendu from a historic fountain in Denmark.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iyuoqmgcqdfd1.png?width=1061&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41dc1b7189a1a4494148ddaf2b8f834975af9679\n\nWe had KENDU members go to the BTC Conference in Nashville this weekend! Chads and Chadettes have created all types of ways to spread the project.\n\nWe had a member who hosted a Kendu sponsored nightclub event in Kolkata India\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g9bjukkdqdfd1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8da25c247f2ae3486c53bb5dd9e4c7b6745f4ad0\n\nI want to share some information about the community in the form of some examples/stories to give outsiders the facts and I guess to encourage you to DYOR and at least come into the Telegram (9901 members strong). Remember that coming into the TG is like a free test drive with no strings attached of your favorite uber expensive sports car like a Lamborghini, or Buggati. That is a huge opportunity.\n\nI lurked in the community for about a week or two before buying in and was posting a bit here and there with questions from time to time. One night I decided to take it to the next level of participation and hop into the voice chat to ask a question. I have no problem admitting that my question felt a bit silly and random, especially considering that I wasn't sure if the VC was for planning next moves, hanging out, high level business like meetings for those on the inside, etc. My innocuous question was met with kindness and actual answers. NOTE: I was curious about the KENDU INU bike helmet ( Hey, chill I needed a new bike helmet so my kids didn't call me out on my clear hypocrisy. Why not support my most important investment). I bought it by the way from the Merch store that was started by a community member around 1 million MC. The dev doesn't have time for that and gives us freedom to use our skills and use the brand!\n\nIF you are still reading this, that might be a miracle, but I have to share how welcome I felt. The fact that one of these Chads knew the answer about the specific item speaks volumes about the work ethic and care for this project and I ended up chatting a bit with the crew on VC. We talked about a couple things even meandering into the culture and community building that I know has been built in KENDU's chat and community. When I had to go I was actually encouraged to come back sometime and not be a stranger. Every time a new member comes into the community at least one or two people welcome them and address them in the TG. EVERYTIME, I have been watching and picking up on these little things. IT IS AN AMAZING THING YET....maybe not so amazing. Sometimes they talk right away sometimes they don’t no pressure.\n\nI believe the people on the ground floor understand exactly what they are doing on so many levels, one of which being how to build community and a positive one at that. We are constantly evolving. I had a convo with someone a day or two ago on Reddit about something that happened where this Chad got banned after some unsavory interactions with members and I searched the chat to see that some divisive topics had been blacklisted from the chat after that situation. Maybe things weren't perfect, but I saw the response to some divisive content and that is important. Even just tonight I saw words added to the list of blacklisted wroding as it is not helping the mission. Crucial and important and we don't need to talk about that cuck engagement farmer. \n\nEvery measure is done to protect the community. I have seen a couple moments where someone has been banned in chat. I don't see the spammed messages or any divisive commentary make it far at all and apparently some of this is done in real time manually. This is hugely important to keep the community laser focused over our shared goal of changing Defi and spreading awareness about a game changing Ecosystem. Of course making a fat pile of money is a goal too, but also to help us grow connected as humans that might just trust one another to each do their part, hold the line until the goal is reached. Trust is important!\n\nThe \"Kendu Loyalist\" crew leads from the top answering all questions and welcoming new people in a really genuine way. It is exceptional.\n\nAlright last thing to mention is that the culture also is about organic unpaid growth:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/epgd6f5fqdfd1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbe047d0c99d0f62b024e723fc635f9b8ffd9a6b\n\nNotice the kindness and honesty from one of our Chad or Chadettes. Look how far KENDU has already risen with no paid nothing! This is the ethos and approach that is all over the chat and I believe it will stick no matter when we swell to 10K TG members. The point is that something big is growing here and it is beautiful and it makes me believe even more. Not to mention people are working constantly.\n\nSome of the funnest and funniest moments are when someone has come into the TG as an influencer with a big head. Thinking they alone can help us. It usually starts with, “Nice project you have here.” and it is great to see. They get a bus ticket, but everyone also gets the reinforced ethos that we don’t pay for anything. There is no marketing budget. You want to pay for a billboard do it, you want to pay for a big CEX listing, do it.  Not so much if the person gets the hint, but if that self proclaimed influencer happens to be self centered…good luck!\n\nTo wrap things up with Point #2: I came back after about a day outside of chat to 7900 messages one day. Another day after sleeping cause everyone has to do it: 1433 messages. It is unreal the culture that has been built, so come check us out. You are witnessing a real deal project that you owe it to yourself to check out. You have been informed!\n\nOf course have to mention the Kendu Chads timer is about 3 days and 10 hours left!!!! Utility/usecase/dApp/earn cold hard ETH/change Defi!!!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wlx15e8gqdfd1.png?width=2288&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4ef55a8498d342ec691001a7cd7204e41c5bbf7\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)",

    "selftext": "Criminally Undervalued Tech is Waking Up\n\nThe bear market has always been brutal for projects - most small ones don't make it or have cashed out and moved on leaving loyal holders with the bag.\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.coingecko.com\\/en\\/coins\\/saito](https://preview.redd.it/vonjhy9q6red1.jpg?width=1275&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=805b1dedb54eb59ef2aeb0365e0a205c1e00eb55)\n\nBut the reason we keep coming back for altcoins is because that's where innovation happens, and we all know the rewards that come from taking those risks.\n\nBut choosing a good altcoin is extremely hard. Projects prey upon your lust for large returns and confuse you with technical nonsense that only sounds good.\n\nIt can be extremely hard for even experienced crypto traders to figure out much of the new tech, and if it is valuable.\n\nWith this in mind, there are two **key traits** of an altcoin that has the potential for **deep fundamental value.**\n\n1. **Active development through the bear market**: Projects that build through the bear show strong evidence they aren't designed to scam holders - if they were, they would simply cash out and stop working.\n2. **Easy to Use Apps**: Applications that are easy to get started and use show the most promise for adoption.\n\nThe only project I can think of which aces both of these key traits is Saito. And that’s not even the best part: **Saito is trading for less than memecoins.** At 12mm market cap (18mm diluted), this may be the most undervalued tech in crypto.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lhzfrckt6red1.jpg?width=724&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f248304da492ab69406c5c35be5544bb026c2b04\n\nPay attention, because Saito has started marketing in a way which has never been seen before in the project - it's clearly stirring up enthusiasm as people discover how groundbreaking Saito actually is.\n\nAnd some people think this marketing push is going to include a long-awaited exchange listing.\n\n**Fundamentals**\n\nSaito is a unique layer-1 project supporting trustless, P2P internet. When the term \"Web3\" was invented, this was what it originally described - Saito is building true Web3, not just slapping the label onto anything with crypto.\n\nThey built all through the bear and have Web3 apps anyone (including Grandma) can use in one-click, without logging in. Routing work and ATR underlie Saito and give it some incredible capabilities for scale that are hard to explain, but worth researching.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/31t4lpew6red1.jpg?width=605&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ecfa18b986e67318d3ba80ab6d1a31992120fc56\n\n**Community**\n\nAny community member that researches Saito deeply becomes a diehard 'Saitozen.' It is literally like taking the Red Pill from The Matrix. Once you see how Saito works, you don't look at other blockchains the same way.\n\nEven through a brutal bear market the Saito community held strong. We helped build Red Square and polish it to a level that no P2P app has seen before - and now we don't even need Telegram.\n\nWe're the only Web3 project that actually built our community a home on the blockchain.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bq28tb9z6red1.jpg?width=958&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=068493e88be9809329c7a5f503bb7e93e522c260\n\nNot only that, but we have a rich gaming community. Saito Game Engine allows classic strategy games to be played securely without a middleman, and it's attracted some of the best players of Settlers, Twilight Struggle and more.\n\nWe've also just released third-party crypto which integrates seamlessly into all the games, including multi-player P2P poker. If you've never experienced a true P2P game of poker before, it's mind-blowing how easy it is to do on Saito.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m9tj6ti27red1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fc7bc7d94ba163ec4a4946d74327a759fdb5e52\n\nEverything on Saito is your public key pair. You have full ownership of all your data, accounts, interactions. And Saito makes infrastructure which supports this economically sustainable - that's the big deal!\n\nThe internet now is ran by monopolistic, predatory companies that spy on their users - Saito is the opposite. Because of this, all of the crypto ecosystem can benefit from Saito's P2P internet.\n\nSaito community doesn't compete with other cryptos, it integrates them and offers them something they can't get anywhere else.\n\n**Saito Summer**\n\nSaito Summer is like a makeover for Saito - the underlying character isn't changing, but we're finally presenting Saito in a way the masses can appreciate.\n\nSo far we're only two events in, but it's already rallied the community and given a renewed sense of purpose. OGs are reinvigorated, new people are getting their minds absolutely blown by Saito and wondering how they never heard about it before.\n\nEth wallet integration and now P2P Livestreaming beta 'Swarmcasting' busting down the walls of what people thought was possible on crypto. Saito is not just about money, it's about a new internet and every application rollout proves that.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pdu7xmd87red1.jpg?width=931&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e88fd77b9c65bb448aa03e0f8d817b576ab33cd8\n\n**Summer Burn**\n\nSaito max supply used to be 10bn, and the extra was reserved for block rewards to make the network more secure. But now that adoption is picking up organically, they aren’t needed. Saito just burned 2bn last year, and as of this week, they burned 1bn more. The total is now 7bn tokens.\n\nThe team is committed to the community here. Holders benefit from these burns and that’s the team’s priority.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d9lqf4yb7red1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a87f55766e8df43aadfe436c6a0004afc7e11840\n\n**Exchange Listing**\n\nThe Saito Team has been talking about a large CEX listing for a long time, but they have been very upfront about the predatory practices they want to avoid. Even going as far as to say that they have been offered deals by big exchanges to dump on holders, but rejected them.\n\nThe integrity of the Saito team to actually put in the extra work to only take deals that benefit holders, and not destroy them, is unheard of in most altcoins.\n\nSome people are thinking that the exchange listing they've been talking about will come during Saito Summer, and the teasing for the next drop (this Thursday) has been secretive.\n\n**Overall Market**\n\nWith the BTC ETF a huge success, the Ethereum ETF close by,  and potential rate cuts in the upcoming months, the timing for Saito to wake up could not be any better.",

    "selftext": "Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nWe went through a tough couple of weeks.\n\nThe recent events led to BTC dropping as low as **$53K**, causing **fear in the market** and many weak hands to either sell their entire holdings or scale down on their positions at the **worst possible occasion**.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zb3hafyajvdd1.jpg?width=963&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bea615499825787344eed404f90213cd2fa02847\n\n  \nJust as there couldn't be a worse moment to sell your beloved crypto, there wasn't a better time to get a position or top up your bags **at such a discount**.\n\n \n\nWhen you have your eyes on **good projects with strong fundamentals**, you need to take calculated risks and buy the jeets' bags.\n\nAfter only 5 days from a moment of \"**Extreme Fear**\", based on the \"**Fear and Greed Index**\", we're now back at a decent level of \"**Greed**\".\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pmhj6nfcjvdd1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e42f279382b2fd59527fb383b61b37b8db6925f1\n\n  \nOne of the ways to distinguish a good project from a less good one is to pay attention to **how the chart responds** when the market goes up after a dip.\n\nGood projects with strong fundamentals have already **shown signs of a strong reversal**, gaining **50%**, **100%** or even more from the lowest point touched during the market crash.\n\n\n\nOne of those projects is certainly **$KENDU (Kendu Inu),** which went from as low as **$68M** back to almost **$150M** as soon as the market showed some strength.\n\n \n\nThat is an extremely bullish indicator to look for in a project.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h87d2ntdjvdd1.jpg?width=871&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2288fcc8d9531332c4aef39aacc4c862f4b10593\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gzlpbzpejvdd1.jpg?width=1105&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ee3b056690d239a32a4d0364037703ce7b87b1f\n\n  \n**COMMUNITY SENTIMENT**\n\nAnother important thing to look for is **how active the community is during a market crash**.\n\n \n\n**Most \"projects\" go straight to zero or almost in this phase.** People in the TG group go silent, stop raiding, are sad, and eventually start looking around at the next shiny thing.\n\nThis never happens at **$KENDU**.\n\nThere is such a **big core group of OGs** who are always ready to **work and lead by example**. People coming to the Telegram group are always surprised by the warm welcome and the work ethic of the **$KENDU army**.\n\n**The Kendu Inu community is more active during the dips than most communities are at ATHs.**\n\nYou want a **very active community** that is **always positive** about the project and ready to spread the word, especially when all the others around you are **too lazy and depressed** to do so.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cbf2wjpgjvdd1.jpg?width=1079&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6bb459e0141fb998c9ba991fd2e300793ff1b977\n\n  \n**COMMUNITY GROWTH**\n\n**But how fast is this strong Kendu community growing?**\n\nWell, let's look at the data. Data does not lie.\n\n \n\n**The project launched on Feb 21st.**\n\n**May 1st --&gt;** **160** members of the subreddit - **1300** on-chain holders – listed on **1 CEX**\n\n**Jun 1st --&gt; 1345** members of the subreddit- **6000** on-chain holders – listed on **2 CEXs**\n\n**July 19th --&gt;** **3554** members of the subreddit – **12701** on-chain holders – listed on **14 CEXs**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ay6ubk5jjvdd1.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98f10c2f3a8d6be101230fe6095bc25a64c97007\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/knuuxqakjvdd1.jpg?width=770&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20b9cc0eb5139ffa7fe26fc868681ab46510961d\n\n\n\n**100% organic**, after a slow start, Kendu Inu has seen exponential growth in the last couple of months.\n\n**Kendu Inu has a very strong floor** thanks to diamond-handed holders with a big vision, a beautiful chart, **holders count growing daily** and good supply distribution where nobody holds more than roughly **2%.**\n\n \n\n**That is the result of a combination of:**\n\n-            Fair launch\n\n-            Organic growth\n\n-            No supply to KOLs\n\n-            No big influencers calling you from the start and letting jeets form the floor.\n\n-            An army with an extreme work ethic\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7ex1em6ojvdd1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=821eae8a1510fe03977c5d6378c82b233cb4485c\n\n  \n**SUPPORTED BY SHYTOSHI KUSAMA  - TOP 50 MOST INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE IN CRYPTO –**\n\n**Shytoshi Kusama** was included in the list of the **top 50 most influential people in the whole crypto space** earlier this year, as he has a huge reputation and a **multi-billion dollar project** under his leadership.\n\nHe recently left an interview where he said his goal for **SHIB** is to reach **One trillion dollar** market cap ($1000b).\n\nHe would never risk any of that to support a project that is either a **scam** or a mere **pump and dump.**\n\nAs of today, Kusama has followed the page on X and joined the Telegram group to say hi and ask for details after **$KENDU** went from **$2.8M** to **$60M** market cap in just a few days.\n\n\n\nHe asked: \"**Why up so much? lol**\"\n\n\n\nIt has also been confirmed that he has been holding a fat bag of **$KENDU** since at least **$1M** market cap.\n\nEven though all details have yet to be revealed, it is known that **$KENDU** will play a role in the Shib ecosystem, which might explain Shytoshi's involvement in Kendu Inu.\n\nMake no mistake, though, Miazaki has always said that **Kendu has its own identity** and will not just be one of the small dogs existing under the SHIB umbrella.\n\nAt the same time, being a partner of the 2^(nd) biggest meme coin that ever existed from such an early stage is an extraordinary achievement.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/40n7n95rjvdd1.jpg?width=848&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50b589b892f9d21e99e0c28b03f2118bdc922d41\n\n  \n**COINBASE LIKES THE STOCK**\n\nNews from last week: **Coinbase Wallet** showcased **Kendu Inu** in their new video ad (you can find it pinned on their X page)\n\n**$KENDU** is the only meme project displayed there that is not in the multi-billions of market cap.\n\n\n\nTo be specific, these are the market caps of all the coins/tokens displayed in the video ad (at the time of the video being posted):\n\n**KENDU**: $104 Million  \n**USDC**: $33 Billion  \n**SOL**: $66 Billion  \n**BTC**: $1.2 Trillion  \n**ETH**: $371 Billion  \n**USDT**: $112 Billion  \n**MATIC**: $5.0 Billion  \n**PEPE**: $3.7 Billion\n\n\n\nThe second smallest meme **coin** in the video is $PEPE, which is sitting at $5.1b, about 40x from where $KENDU is right now.\n\n**Read between the lines, people.**\n\nThe craziest thing about it all is that Dev said he had nothing to do with the Coinbase video ad.\n\nHe said \"I wish I could tell you I have buddies at Coinbase, but I don't. **That's because of you guys.**\"\n\n**Community-driven** projects focused on **organic growth** are the best.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1t00f79tjvdd1.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1bfde4f8acf79135b48b5ccde8f996a983f1f06\n\n  \n**BULLISH ARTICLES**\n\n**Cointelegraph article 1** --&gt; **Kendu Inu — The one Inu that aims to rule them all** --&gt; This article highlights the organic nature of Kendu Inu and its success in reaching new ATHs while the entire market was dipping.\n\n \n\n**Shib Mag** --&gt; **Kendu: The Wild Card That Could Reshape the Shiba Inu Universe** --&gt; This article highlights that $KENDU is on a mission to forge its own identity and aims at revolutionizing the entire meme coin space.\n\n \n\n**CMC article 1** --&gt; **6 Best Altcoins to Buy Now** --&gt; Coinmarketcap puts $KENDU as the n.1 altcoin to buy among the ones in the article.\n\n \n\n**CMC article 2** --&gt; **Top 4 Altcoins With Upward Breakout Potential** --&gt; Coinmarketcap puts $KENDU as the n.2 altcoin with breakout potential, after KASPA.\n\n**CryptoResearch** --&gt; **Top 10 Gainers in June 2024** --&gt; Kendu Inu takes the first spot as the #1 gainer for the month of June **(177.5%),** beating other fast-growing projects such as BRETT (**72.8%**), POPCAT (**57.3%**), and KASPA (**39%**).\n\n \n\n**\\*\\*I'm not sure Reddit is going to like too many links in the same post, so I'll avoid linking them.

He says the **Kendu Inu Ecosystem** **will be the biggest in DeFi**, meaning there are big plans for Kendu in these coming months.\n\n \n\nKendu Inu's first **dAPP** is about to be released to the public.\n\n**Kendu Chads** is not the final boss, it is only **the first piece of a big puzzle**.\n\nKendu Miazaki has left hints about what that may or may not be throughout the weeks.\n\n \n\n**What we do know about Kendu Chads to date, is:**\n\n* You need at least **5M** tokens to participate\n* It is not staking\n* You can earn **ETH** with it\n\n \n\nThere are no (and never will be) \"**sell the news**\" events at **Kendu Inu**. Therefore, details about Kendu will only be known once the **dApp** is out and ready to be used.\n\n \n\nEven though Miazaki is an \"alpha vault\" (meaning he does not release info on the future on Kendu beforehand; he creates and then tells you what it is once it's done), he's hinted at the fact that **the goal is for Kendu to last for a long time, definitely more than a cycle**.\n\nHe once responded positively to a question from someone asking him if Kendu was supposed to maintain his value during a bear market.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s5ix9mfxjvdd1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1d565ff999ee91ed8b967f58354113a219af522\n\n  \n**WHERE IS THE MARKET HEADED?**\n\nIt is clear that the cycle is, so far, repeating itself.\n\n**There is no better entry than now** if you want to get into a project. Take a look at the picture below (right side) and see where we currently stand:\n\n**On the final dip that usually precedes the start of the real bull run.**\n\nWe had the **BTC ETF** come out in January, and we have the **ETH ETF** going live just a few days from now.\n\n**Rate cuts are planned for Q4**, and that, combined with the expected result of the **US elections**, should signal the start of the most fun part of the **bull run**.\n\nThere is going to be so much money flowing into the space.\n\nEvery project that is not a scam and has done well these past few months will inevitably do well in the coming bull run.\n\nAnd when there is so much greed in the air that every shitcoin is in the green, what do you think is going to happen to such a strong project like [$KENDU](https://x.com/search?q=%24KENDU&amp;src=cashtag_click)?\n\n\"Multi billions is not the goal. It is my standard\" - Kendu Miazaki.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kvi3duf0kvdd1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b53dc19a76aa0c8f29b2e85ba2d7eac38c48ccf\n\n  \n**HOW TO LEARN MORE ABOUT KENDU INU**\n\n* Check out @**Kenduinu** and @**Kendumiazaki on X**\n* Check out this other post I wrote about **$KENDU**: [https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1dums5l/13\\_reasons\\_why\\_you\\_should\\_hold\\_a\\_fat\\_bag\\_of\\_kendu/](https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1dums5l/13_reasons_why_you_should_hold_a_fat_bag_of_kendu/)\n* Come visit us at [](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenduinu_Ecosystem/) on Reddit to interact with the community and ask questions.\n\n  \nCMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)\n\nCG: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu)",

    "selftext": "The valuation model is constructed around these main variables:\n\n* Total Value of Products and Services (TVPS): This metric assesses the aggregate value of all goods and services that can be purchased with the currency, providing a direct measure of its economic utility.\n* Stock to Flow Ratio (SFR): Calculated as the ratio of total supply to new supply, this metric provides an insight into the currency’s scarcity.\n* Total Supply: Represents the aggregate number of currency units currently in circulation.\n* New Supply: Fixed annual increase in total supply, adding predictability to the currency's inflation rate.\n* Velocity of Money (VOM): Measures the frequency at which each currency unit is used for transactions within a specified timeframe, indicating the liquidity and economic activity of the currency.\n\nThe Formula:Coin Value = (TVPS / (Total Supply \\* VOM) \\* SFRThe Total Value of Products and Services (TVPS) is a crucial metric in determining the value of a coin, especially in frameworks where the coin is used as a medium of exchange within a specific economy or ecosystem. Here’s how it significantly impacts the coin's value:\n\n1. Direct Measure of Economic Utility: TVPS represents the aggregate value of all goods and services that can be bought using the coin over a certain period, usually a year. This measure reflects the economic utility of the coin—how useful it is for actual transactions. A higher TVPS indicates that the coin is widely accepted and used, thereby increasing its practical value.\n2. Basis for Demand: The more goods and services a coin can buy, the higher the demand for that coin might be. If a coin is the only or primary means of purchasing significant services and products, its necessity and thus its value would likely increase as more users adopt it for daily transactions.\n3. Indicator of Stability and Growth: An increasing TVPS suggests that the economy or ecosystem around the coin is growing. Stability in TVPS or consistent growth can signal to investors and users that the coin is a reliable store of value, potentially driving up its price due to increased confidence.\n4. Pricing Mechanism: In a market where multiple currencies (digital or fiat) compete, the TVPS can serve as a crucial differentiator. It helps in pricing the coin relative to others by showcasing its purchasing power parity within its operational ecosystem. If a coin can purchase more or higher-value services and goods compared to another, it can be perceived as having a higher inherent value.\n5. Feedback Loop for Development: A robust TVPS can encourage further investments into the services and products priced in the coin. This, in turn, can create a positive feedback loop where increased utility leads to higher demand, which then drives further economic activities denominated in the coin.\n\nIn sum, TVPS is not just a reflection of the coin’s current worth but also a forward-looking indicator that can influence investor behavior, user adoption, and overall market dynamics surrounding the coin. By effectively measuring and potentially increasing the TVPS, stakeholders can strategically enhance the perceived and real value of the coin within its operating environment. The Velocity of Money is a critical economic indicator in assessing the value of a coin, especially in systems where the coin functions as an active medium of exchange. Here's a detailed look at how the velocity of money impacts a coin's value:\n\n1. Measurement of Economic Activity: Velocity of money refers to the rate at which money is exchanged from one transaction to another and measures how frequently a unit of currency is used to purchase goods and services within a given time period. High velocity indicates a high level of economic activity, as the currency is quickly changing hands, suggesting strong demand and usage.\n2. Influence on Supply and Demand Dynamics: In a cryptocurrency or any monetary system, if the velocity of the currency is high, it implies that each unit of currency is being used repeatedly to facilitate transactions. This can effectively increase the supply of money in circulation without physically increasing the total supply, impacting inflation and the purchasing power of the currency.\n3. Indicator of Economic Health and Confidence: A higher velocity of money typically signifies a healthy, active economy where confidence in the stability and utility of the currency is strong. People are more likely to spend the currency rather than hold onto it, which can support a higher valuation as it reflects trust and utility in the medium of exchange.\n4. Relationship with Price Levels: According to the equation of exchange in economics, MV=PQ (where M is the money supply, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Q is the output of goods and services), an increase in the velocity of money, assuming a constant money supply, can lead to higher price levels. This relation can also influence the value of the coin, as changes in price levels (inflation or deflation) directly affect how much the coin is worth in terms of purchasing power.\n\nIn summary, the velocity of money is a multifaceted indicator that not only reflects the current state of an economy or a specific currency’s ecosystem but also actively influences the perceived and intrinsic value of the coin through its effects on economic activity, supply-demand balances, and inflationary pressures. Understanding and strategically managing this velocity can be key to enhancing a currency’s value and stability.The Stock to Flow Ratio is a significant metric, particularly in the context of commodities like gold and silver, and has been adapted to assess the value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The SFR measures the scarcity of a particular asset and is calculated by dividing the total stock (existing supply) by the flow (annual production rate). Here’s how it plays a crucial role in determining a coin's value:\n\n1. Measure of Scarcity: The SFR directly quantifies the scarcity of an asset. A higher ratio indicates that the asset is less readily available relative to its production, suggesting greater scarcity. For cryptocurrencies, a high SFR implies that new coins are being added to the total supply at a slow rate compared to the existing stock, which can enhance the perception of the coin as a scarce resource.\n2. Indicator of Value Over Time: Historically, assets with higher SFR (like gold and silver) have maintained their value over long periods due to their scarcity and lower rates of supply expansion. In cryptocurrencies, a rising S2F ratio over time can signal that the coin is becoming increasingly scarce, potentially driving up its value if demand remains steady or increases.\n3. Influence on Investor Perception: Investors often view assets with high SFR as \"harder\" assets. In the realm of cryptocurrencies, a high SFR can attract investors looking for assets that are less susceptible to inflation or dilution, much like traditional store-of-value assets such as gold.\n4. Predictive Power for Future Prices: Some models, particularly those applied to Bitcoin, have used the SFR to predict future price increases. These models assume that as the production rate decreases (typically through mechanisms like halving events in Bitcoin), the reduced flow relative to the existing stock will drive up prices.\n5. Comparison Across Assets: The SFR model allows for a comparison between different assets based on their scarcity. This can be particularly useful in the cryptocurrency market, where different coins have different issuance schedules and caps, affecting their SFR and, consequently, their perceived long-term value.\n\nIn summary, the Stock to Flow ratio is a crucial metric for assessing the scarcity and potential long-term value of a coin. It provides a quantitative foundation that helps investors and analysts understand how the rarity of an asset relates to its market value and helps predict how its price may evolve based on changes in supply dynamics. This makes SFR a valuable tool for strategic investment decisions in both commodity markets and the growing field of digital currencies.\n\n# Data and Analysis\n\nFor this analysis, we are only using Tesla's total revenue from all its products and services, including the hypothetical addition of robotics and expanded licensing of Full Self-Driving technology, amounts to $250 billion. This figure will serve as the Total Value of Products and Services (TVPS) in our model to estimate the value of a hypothetical digital coin associated with Tesla. Parameters for the Coin Valuation Model:\n\n* Total Value of Products and Services: $250 billion\n* Total Supply: 144.33 billion coins\n* Velocity of Money: 0.02\n* New Annual Supply: 5.256 billion coins\n\nSFR = Total Supply / New Annual Supply = 27.45Base Coin Value = TVPS / (Total Supply \\* VOM) = $86.61Coin Value = Base Value \\* SFR = $2,377.65This derived coin value reflects the combined economic utility and scarcity of the coin within this modeled framework. It illustrates how significant the scale of Tesla’s operations could potentially influence the value of a digital currency linked to its economic activities and scarcity dynamics. This model provides a theoretical financial metric that can help in understanding the impact of corporate revenue and production strategies on associated digital assets.\n\n# Discussion\n\nIn this study, we utilized a composite model integrating traditional economic indicators with modern financial metrics specific to digital currencies to derive the value of a hypothetical coin associated with Tesla's economic activities. The Stock to Flow Ratio is instrumental in differentiating this model from traditional fiat currency models, such as those used for the [$USD](https://x.com/search?q=%24USD&amp;src=cashtag_click). Unlike fiat currencies, which are typically inflationary due to their increasing supply, the modeled digital coin has a predefined supply growth rate, leading to an increasing SFR over time. This increment in the SFR indicates a decreasing rate at which new coins are added relative to the existing supply, enhancing the coin's scarcity and potential value. In contrast to fiat currencies like the USD, which lose purchasing power over time due to inflationary pressures and policy-driven supply increases, a digital currency with a high and increasing SFR is designed to gain purchasing power. This is primarily due to its comparative scarcity and reduced rate of new supply introduction, which, ceteris paribus, should lead to an appreciation in value if demand remains constant or grows. The mechanism here is akin to that of precious metals like gold, which have historically served as hedges against inflation. This model suggests that digital currencies with increasing SFR could command a premium in the financial markets. Investors might view such currencies as safer stores of value over the long term, particularly in economic environments where traditional currencies are depreciating. The analysis thus highlights the potential of [#Dogecoin](https://x.com/search?q=%23Dogecoin&amp;src=hashtag_click)  to not only serve as effective mediums of exchange but also as robust long-term investments that may outperform inflationary fiat currencies in maintaining purchasing power. The increased Stock to Flow Ratio (SFR) of a digital currency like Dogecoin suggests a growing scarcity and potential appreciation in value over time compared to more inflationary currencies such as the USD. In economic terms, as Dogecoin becomes scarcer and its purchasing power potentially increases, the relative cost of goods and services priced in Dogecoin should logically decrease if these prices are indexed to a currency experiencing inflation, like the [USD.To](http://USD.To) integrate this into pricing strategies, businesses could apply an indexed discount for payments made with Dogecoin, reflecting its expected long-term appreciation. This discount reflects not only the current exchange rate but also the anticipated future value of Dogecoin, thereby incentivizing customers to use the cryptocurrency for transactions. It also compensates for the potential 'opportunity cost' of spending a deflationary currency today rather than holding it. This approach can benefit both consumers and businesses:\n\n* For Consumers: It provides a tangible benefit to using Dogecoin over traditional currencies, potentially saving money due to the currency's appreciation.\n* For Businesses: It encourages more transactions in Dogecoin, increasing its circulation and utility as a currency. Moreover, businesses that hold onto Dogecoin received from transactions may benefit from its appreciation.\n\nTransforming Dogecoin from a speculative asset into a functional currency also change the dynamics of its volatility:\n\n* Increased Utility: As Dogecoin transitions to being used more as a currency than an asset, its utility in everyday transactions increases. This widespread use can help stabilize its value as it becomes more integrated into regular economic activities.\n* Reduced Speculation: When a cryptocurrency like Dogecoin is primarily used for speculation, its price is highly susceptible to market sentiments and speculative trading. As it shifts towards functioning as a currency, its value becomes more closely tied to its utility and less to investor speculation.\n* Market Depth and Liquidity: Increased usage as a currency can enhance market depth and liquidity. This means more buyers and sellers at any given time, which typically reduces price volatility because the market can absorb larger transactions without impacting the price significantly.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe proposed valuation model for [$Doge](https://x.com/search?q=%24Doge&amp;src=cashtag_click) provides a robust framework that combines principles from traditional hard money systems with modern digital economy analytics. This approach allows for a more grounded and economically justified valuation of digital currencies, which can help stabilize perceptions and foster more informed decision-making in financial markets. The base value of $86.61 for [$Doge](https://x.com/search?q=%24Doge&amp;src=cashtag_click) should be regarded as the logical fundamental value of the coin, given the TVPS. The fundamental value is rarely reflected on open markets that are more driven by human sentiment. Factoring in SFR combined with an increasing TVPS can push the coin value to non-reasonable levels when observed from a fundamental perspective. If Dogecoin provides premium access to General Artificial Intelligence, Self Driving Vehicles and Humanoid Robots, the estimated value of ≈$2,500 is too low.\n\n\n\n[Dogecoin price today, DOGE to USD live price, marketcap and chart | CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/)",

Love it or hate it, Ethereum is the king of all chains and sees fewer scams than all the other jeet chains such as SOL and BASE.\n\nSince Kendu Inu is on ETH, and the liquidity pool is paired with ETH (KENDU:ETH), **when ETH goes up in value, so does KENDU**. As simple as that.\n\nThe news of the coming **ETH ETF** is super bullish news for all KENDU holders, both **short-term** and **long-term** investors.\n\n \n\n\n\n**10)  GREAT-LOOKING CHART**\n\nEven CMC, in their recent article, admitted that $KENDU chart looks very good and **on the verge of a breakout** from a pure TA standpoint, and they’re not aware of all the **alphas** behind the projects and all the future implementations that are going to be unveiled.\n\nSo, if you like technical analysis, you will like Kendu Inu chart.\n\n \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qj0ni16trcad1.jpg?width=1443&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba099af75818df6ddb9dbe44ea69aa2146656cc3\n\n\n\n**11)  GOAL: FIRST MEME COIN TO EVER CROSS $100b**\n\nWhile every other project in the meme sphere tries hard to reach $1b market cap, at Kendu inu, we think that to be an embarrassing goal.\n\nWhile Miazaki says that **“$10b is programmed**”, meaning it is inevitable, the real goal that excites our community is to be the first meme coin ever to cross $100b market cap.\n\nMiazaki’s bio on Telegram says: “**Taking $KENDU to $100 BILLION and beyond!**”\n\nMany experts expect this to be a “**super cycle**” and even more a “**meme super cycle**”, meaning we expect not only more liquidity to be deployed in the whole crypto space compared to 2021, but also that **meme coins will grab a much bigger % of that liquidity** flowing around compared to last cycle.\n\n**We can then expect new ATHs for well-established projects** such as DOGE and SHIB, and that’s why, at KENDU, we’re working towards that $100b MC goal, which will not look as unrealistic at the peak of the bull run as it may does right now.\n\n \n\n\n\n**12)  LOW MARKET CAP ≠ MORE GAINS**\n\nMany people have been led to believe that the lower the market cap of a certain token, the better chance of making a 100x or 1000x. That is SO wrong and misleading.\n\n90% or more of the “projects”, especially when launched on Solana or Base, **are complete scams**. Period.\n\nThe other 0.99% are projects created with the best intentions, but that, unfortunately, are going absolutely nowhere.\n\n**Kendu Inu, at this stage, is bulletproof**. It has proved its value to everybody. “**We’re too big to fail**” is what Miazaki always says.\n\nKendu is going nowhere but up.\n\nWith such ambitious goals, a **100x means reaching about $15b market cap** (at the time of this writing), which is far from being out of reach for Kendu, especially considering we are about to enter what it’s supposed to be the **biggest cycle ever** (especially for meme coins).\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that when you invest in **super-low MC projects**, liquidity is so thin that any whale exiting their position leads to a cascade of sales caused by fear, especially since it’s not uncommon for investors of small projects to hold 5-10% of the total supply.\n\nOn bigger projects, instead, since liquidity is way thicker, you can **enter and exit your positions more accurately** without having nightmares about being rugged while asleep.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1a4row5fqcad1.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ab676c8aab4bd351620875cf6b919d71522a86a\n\n  \n\n\n**13) BEAUTIFUL SUPPLY REDISTRIBUTION**\n\nAt Kendu Inu, redistribution is ongoing **24/7**. When the market cap goes up, the number of holders goes up. When the market cap goes down, even significantly, the number of holders still goes up!\n\nAnd that’s counting on-chain holders only! **With millions of $ of daily volume on CEXs**, God knows how many holders we actually have.\n\n\n\nTo make money with altcoins, especially memes, you need to understand two things:\n\n1. What a good project is\n2. Buy when everybody else is afraid to do it.\n\nKendu IS a good project.\n\nNow, you have the opportunity to buy or top up your bags at 40% of the ATH.\n\n\n\nIf you like Kendu, this is the best time to become part of the army. See you on the other side!\n\n  \nCMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)\n\nCG: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu)",

If we’re talking mass adoption, we have to do something special not only for our community but also for everyone else who is not part of the $DOG army. We have to reach out, spread awareness, create content, and do it in such a fun way to gain interest from people who are not heavily involved in this space.\n\n\n\nThe entire purpose of this project has everything we need to spread awareness and more:\n\n\n\n\t1.\tWe earn the funds for the treasury, and we don’t do it with donations.  \n(We get a monster budget to promote $DOG on almost every platform you can think of.)\n\n\t2.\tThe community and newcomers actually receive something in return for participating.  \n(100k limited edition plushies, with 3 variants: common, uncommon, rare.)\n\n\t3.\tWe will hold contests by having people post their plushies, both influencers and common      participants.  \n(Social recognition.)\n\n\t4.\tNHC will host giveaways, contests, and promotions for their customers and followers.  \n(Bringing a whole different crowd to this space.)\n\n\t5.\tThis raises curiosity in future young Bitcoiners (next-gen $DOG army).\n\n\t6.\tThe chances of this being a ponzi scheme are very, very slim. I don’t think any national brand would dare to ruin their reputation and keep the prize from the winner.\n\n\t7.\tThe prize on the line is huge. We’re talking about millions of dollars if the winner doesn’t cash out.\n\n\t8.\tIf people participate and don’t win, at least they have a piece of $DOG history in their homes, not to mention the rarity aspect of it.\n\n\t9.\tThere’s so much more, but this right here should help your imagination flow. I will do my best in the coming months to explain what's going on in my head and my vision for $DOG.\n\n\n\nPlease check out the X link below to understand the mechanics of this $DOG project. Give it a like, repost, and share it with people who would like to have some $DOG but don’t know how to.\n\n\n\n[https://x.com/VittoPantoliano/status/1806209556546191619](https://x.com/VittoPantoliano/status/1806209556546191619)\n\nHey, check this out!\n👀Dog (Runes) DOG $0.006127 +5.37%\n@CoinMarketCap 🚀\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dog-go-to-the-moon-rune\n",

    "title": "Quick Rant with a Side of Shill",
    "selftext": "**Brief Background:**\n\nI have been in crypto since \\~2017 when I was messing around with ETH and BTC but had to always jeet to get more drinking money in college.\n\nThis past winter I finally started looking at meme coins, after thinking they were the dumbest thing ever and a complete waste of time.\n\nI got into a couple that went nowhere and then got into $KENDU (aped in at $4M MC). I wasn't active in the TG but then finally dove into creating a twitter just to shill. This is where the rant begins.\n\n**Rant:**\n\nCrypto Twitter is one of the worst places on Earth. The amount of bottom of the barrel scum there with KOLs dumping their bags on their followers and only shilling once they get paid a free bag is terrifying.\n\n99%+ of the accounts are just engagement farms, sliding into DMs asking to get paid for promotion or just posting \"GM say it back\".\n\nThere is no sense of creating anything with longevity, it is always \"Shill me something under $1M MC\" or \"What's the next narrative\". Don’t even get me started on the celebrity meta (waste of time)\n\nDon’t truly know what the point of this rant is, but just wanted to get it off my chest and hear everyone's thoughts. I think at the end of the day KOLs and influencers think they have way too much power and people follow them like sheep  and really are just exit liquidity versus wanting to actually build.\n\n**Side of Shill:**\n\nWill try and make this sound as little like a $KENDU bot as possible and won't put this in our main TG to keep the comments somewhat clean lol.\n\nBeing in $KENDU and knowing there has been no paid marketing to KOLs or influencers is what I enjoy the most. Growing the community and coin with no support other than what we do organically feels just like a big middle finger to Crypto Twitter that yes, organic can still work.\n\nWould love for you all to check it out.\n\n  \nCMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)",

    "title": "A Look Into Grayscale's Proposed Privacy ETF &amp; Potential Role of Oasis",
    "selftext": "The financial aspect of crypto is a huge draw for users. Now, despite the volatility of the crypto markets, the lucrative pull is undeniable. So, when Bitcoin ETFs got approved and succeeded, it paved the way for Ethereum ETFs. While early market sentiments are yet to call out the final result if it is a hit or a miss, indications are it will be successful. The focus now shifts to another untapped potential for ETFs - privacy, and it is a big deal.\n\nWhether you are a veteran or a newbie in the ETF scene, Grayscale is a well-known name that inspires confidence. Some sources have suggested that Grayscale is prepped for filing a privacy ETF and they have been considering and monitoring several projects since 2022. Here is the list of assets under consideration:\n\n* 0x (ZRX)\n* 1inch (1INCH)\n* Apecoin (APE)\n* Arweave (AR)\n* Axie Infinity (AXS)\n* Bancor (BNT)\n* BitTorrent (BTT)\n* Bora (BORA)\n* Iota (IOTA)\n* Kava (KAVA)\n* Kyber Network Crystal (KNC)\n* Loopring (LRC)\n* Monero (XMR)\n* Near (NEAR)\n* Numeraire (NMR)\n* [Oasis (ROSE)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/oasis-network/)\n\nWhile Ethereum itself depends on L2 solutions to implement privacy effectively in its ecosystem, there is no dearth of blockchain protocols that have been working in this field and have achieved various degrees of success. As a pioneer in smart privacy for web3 and AI with privacy-preserving technologies in use, [Oasis](https://oasisprotocol.org/)'s inclusion in the above list is as expected. However, before getting into how or why Oasis / $Rose could feature in Grayscale's plans, it is useful first to examine the makeup of the privacy ETF.\n\nEd, a well-known persona in the blockchain and crypto and web3 space, and an engaged Oasis community member with 3+ years of experience being embedded across the ecosystem while contributing towards community building, business development, networking, and marketing activities, has put it all together.\n\nLet's start by looking at what type of projects will constitute this ETF.\n\n* Data Privacy Solution Providers\n* Cyber Service Providers\n* Blockchain-Based Privacy Solutions\n* Network &amp; Communication Security Provider\n* Privacy-Preserving Protocols\n\nThe projects considered also have some eligibility criteria to fulfill before qualifying and we will mention the top 3 here.\n\nFirst, a substantial portion, if not all, of their revenue has to come from one or more of the categories mentioned above. Second, the projects need to be listed on U.S., non-U.S. developed market or emerging market exchanges. Third, the market cap must equal to or in excess of $250M.\n\nProjects are scored as 'primary' or 'secondary' based on three metrics.\n\n1. Data Privacy Solutions, Cyber Services, or Blockchain Privacy Solutions take priority over other sectors\n2. If ALL or just some business operations are aimed at privacy\n3. By alignment with GDPR and CCPA regulations\n\nThe prominence and priority of Oasis in Grayscale's proposed privacy ETF plans becomes evident based on the above discussion as it firmly falls under the 'primary' category. While the fact remains that quite a few of the projects mentioned above in Grayscale's list have lost relevance, Oasis has gone from strength to strength emerging as a regulatory-compliant solution provider in addition to its confidentiality capabilities.\n\nAccording to Ed, this is just the tip of the iceberg and there are other reasons too that underline why Oasis / $Rose is well-positioned in Grayscale's proposed privacy ETF.\n\nTo note, Grayscale has reiterated its principal investment strategy of avoiding exposure to digital assets directly, and still, $Rose has potentially a significant role to play in the privacy ETF when it comes out. Intrigued? The answer lies in a single entity having effected a huge accumulation of $Rose (approximately $440M) on chain through Coinbase. To deep dive into this, [check out Ed's thread](https://x.com/ECrypto0/status/1800135721648546253) on Twitter (X).\n\nFavorable market sentiments of ETFs aside, Grayscale's backing of the privacy narrative is well-deserved and timely. Oasis has always been privacy-focused in line with its founder, Prof. Dawn Song's expertise in computer security and decentralized confidentiality. In conclusion, the potential is all there for a blockbuster privacy ETF with an MVP role by Oasis, but nothing is concrete yet. Hopefully, we will hear something positive very soon.\n\nLet's discuss in the comments what you like about privacy ETFs, and also what other criteria, metrics, and projects you think would make it more robust and impactful.",

Según \\[CoinMarketCap\\]([https://coinmarketcap.com/](https://coinmarketcap.com/)), SLOTHANA ha experimentado un incremento en su volumen de comercio y ha comenzado a captar la atención de inversores interesados en proyectos sostenibles.\n\nAlgunos puntos clave sobre la situación actual de SLOTHANA:\n\n* **Capitalización de Mercado**: Aunque es modesta en comparación con gigantes como Bitcoin y Ethereum, su capitalización ha estado creciendo, lo que sugiere un interés creciente.\n* **Tecnología**: Utiliza un modelo de consenso Proof of Stake (PoS), que es más eficiente energéticamente que el Proof of Work (PoW) utilizado por Bitcoin.\n* **Comunidad**: La comunidad detrás de SLOTHANA está creciendo, con un aumento en el número de seguidores en redes sociales y en foros de criptomonedas.\n\n**Potencial a Futuro**\n\nLa proyección futura de SLOTHANA se basa en varios factores:\n\n1. **Sostenibilidad**: Con la creciente preocupación por el impacto ambiental de las criptomonedas, SLOTHANA podría posicionarse como una alternativa atractiva.\n2. **Innovación Tecnológica**: Si continúan desarrollando su plataforma y mejorando su tecnología, podrían atraer a más desarrolladores y usuarios.\n3. **Adopción**: A medida que más personas y empresas busquen opciones de criptomonedas sostenibles, SLOTHANA podría ver un aumento significativo en su adopción.\n\n**Opiniones y Debate**\n\nMe encantaría escuchar sus opiniones sobre SLOTHANA. ¿Alguien más ha invertido en este proyecto? ¿Qué piensan sobre su enfoque en la sostenibilidad? ¿Creen que tiene el potencial para competir con las criptomonedas más establecidas?\n\nPor favor, compartan sus pensamientos y análisis. ¡Me encantaría ver un debate vibrante en los comentarios!\n\n*Disclaimer*\n\nEste post no es una recomendación de compra. Invertir en criptomonedas implica riesgos, y cada persona debe hacer su análisis personal e individual antes de tomar decisiones de inversión.

Fidelity’s fees have cost me a couple thousand dollars due to their 1% tax on any sell or buy (disregarding my net increase).

Why even make a “stablecoin” that is different but tied to the usd?  I truly don’t understand, but instead of normal bitcoin I get these options:\n\nBTC/USDT,\nBTC/USDC\n\nThey’re even priced differently (although barely)\n\nWhy?

    "selftext": "I will try to simplify this as much as possible:\n\nIn september 2023, I took out a $25k loan (CC balance transfer, 5% fee, 0% interest for the first 12 months).\n\nI put all $25k into bitcoin when it was around 25-27k. I bought 1 bitcoin. Brought my total holdings to 1.57.\n\nWhen bitcoin was 65k this month (may), I sold 0.4 Bitcoin (worth 25k) and used that 25k to completely pay off my credit card debt that I took out in sept. (I will pay the taxes like I always have.)\n\nNow I only have 1.17 bitcoin leftover. As of right now, it's worth about 80k. It bothers me deeply though because my 1.57 used to be worth over $111,000. And now I only have 80k. It's gut wrenching.\n\n**QUESTIONS**:\n\nWas it a GOOD idea of me to pay off the 25k debt by selling at 65k? Or do you think I pulled out too early?\n\nDo you think I should've waited until September to pay off the debt to take advantage of the 0% interest for a couple more months? (The reason I didn't do this was because I was worried there was a chance bitcoin price might be lower in september than it is now) (although everyone thinks its going to go up over the next couple of months)\n\nDo you think it was a bad move of me to sell bitcoin right now considering the fact that we just had a bitcoin halving and everyone is saying bitcoin is going to go up?\n\nI understand it's never wise to take out debt to invest, but IF you were to just re-wind back to september and You from the future time traveled to talk to your september self and they told you to balance transfer credit cards to buy bitcoin, would you do it?",

    "title": "Overly complicated trading strategies will get most people wrecked trading Bitcoin",
    "selftext": "I wanted to share something that has completely changed my trading strategy and results. A few months ago, I came across a pro trader who mentioned that the flag pattern is the only thing you need to make money in any financial market. Intrigued, I decided to give it a try, and I have to say, it’s been more useful than anything else I've tried.\n\nHere's what I've been doing:\n\n1. **Weekly Time Frame**: I focus on the weekly time frame to identify flag patterns. This longer time frame helps filter out the noise and gives a clearer picture of the market trend.\n2. **Spot the Flag**: Whenever I see a flag pattern forming, I make a note of it. For those who don't know, a flag pattern usually consists of a strong price movement (the flagpole) followed by a consolidation phase that forms the flag itself. The breakout from this consolidation phase often signals a continuation of the initial trend.\n3. **Trade in the Direction of the Flag**: Once I identify a flag pattern, I trade in the direction of the breakout. If it's an upward flag, I go long; if it's downward, I short.\n\nI cannot believe how much capital I wasted before discovering this simple yet powerful strategy. It has significantly improved my trading outcomes and confidence.\n\nIf you’re struggling with your trading strategy, I highly recommend giving the flag pattern a try. Has anyone else had similar success with this or any other simple trading strategies?",

    "selftext": "\nI’m holding a bit of both now and I’m thinking BITO (bitcoin futures etf) is almost too good to be true. It gives you a 23% (annualized) dividend payed out each month, AND it seems to follow the price of bitcoin very well. Somebody tell me how this isn’t too good to be true and better than the spot etf.\n\nI held 100 shares of BITO (it’s currently at $26 a share) for one month and got a pay out of $162. If I were to convert more of my bitcoin holdings to it, I could pay my bills with that dividend! That dividend would be killer even just in fiat, but with the gains of bitcoin? Too good.\n\nI take it the catch is that it slips a few percent below the gains of actual bitcoin (and I know, there’s no replacement for cold storage. I have cold storage as well). The fee is almost 1% but again, that’s nothing for a 23% payout. \n\nIf anyone has any resources to better understand how this etf works or can come up with some compelling reasons why not to hold it instead of bitcoin, I’d love to hear. (P.S. I only respond to nice language)",

If you don't want to hold our own keys, and I recommend you do, then just buy the ETFs. Unlike exchanges, the ETFs are legally required to buy the Bitcoin you give them money for at a 1:1 ratio.\n3.

    "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI am trying to better understand the history of the bitcoin blockchain, and I am very curious about the history of encoding non-transaction data a.k.a. arbitrary data within transactions.\n\nCan somebody please point me to some examples of transactions that encoded messages in transactions in the pre-Ethereum era? I am aware of this Rick Roll [one](https://www.blockstream.info/tx/d29c9c0e8e4d2a9790922af73f0b8d51f0bd4bb19940d9cf910ead8fbe85bc9b?expand) from 2013. Are there any particularly famous ones?\n\nI have come to understand that this was a *very* contentious issue within the community around 2013/2014, when OP\\_RETURN was made a standard transaction type. What was discussion like at the time? Are there any key forum threads that I should read to understand the debate?\n\nChatGPT tells me that people also used to embed non-transaction data in transactions through these other means: 1. fake addresses, 2.) unspendable outputs (nulldata transactions), 3.) coinbase transactions, and 4.) multisig transactions.\n\nI am extremely curious to see examples of these as well so I can understand this better. I am aware of Satoshi Nakamoto's genesis block message. ChatGPT says there was a fake address tribute to Turing that somebody else did? I can't find that, though.\n\nLastly, I noticed this section in the [Bitcoin 0.9 Release Notes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.9.0.md):\n\n\"This change is not an endorsement of storing data in the blockchain. The OP\\_RETURN change creates a provably-prunable output, to avoid data storage schemes -- some of which were already deployed -- that were storing arbitrary data such as images as forever-unspendable TX outputs, bloating bitcoin's UTXO database.\"\n\nWhat are these \"data storage schemes\" they were referring to? What were the images being uploaded?\n\nI would be incredibly grateful for any information on this. I really appreciate it.",

    "title": "Memecoins performance after halving?",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone, in this thread I would like to discuss memecoins that blew out this year and have changed the lives of many people.\n\nI started buying crypto in 2019 but I personally don't invest much in smaller memecoins because they are risky and unreliable, but when I discover one that has huge potential, a great community and a strong dev team, I can't help myself and have to buy smaller amounts and watch these tokens increase in value 10x, 50x or even 100x\n\nThis year we've seen several memecoins (BOME, MEW, BRETT, etc.) absolutely explode in price, even before Bitcoin's halving. Therefore, I believe we will see dozens more memecoins do the same this year.\n\nIn this part of my post, I would like to share with you three memecoins that caught my attention recently. I am not advertising these tokens there or telling you to buy them, always DYOR and never listen to random people you don't know, I just want to know your opinion and provide you with some  information after watching and studying these tokens for weeks.\n\nThe tickers are PONKE ([https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ponke/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ponke/)), POWSCHE ([https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/powsche/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/powsche/)) and LINU ([https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/luna-inu-/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/luna-inu-/)). \n\nSome of you can be familiar with PONKE. It is a bigger token aimed at normies with its strong game on instagram, tiktok and twitter. It is already listed on bigger exchanges like Gate, HTX or MEXC.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2vntmntr71xc1.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f414106192574b000af3911408ac718285b58f3c\n\nPOWSCHE is a smaller market cap token with a community that is usual for much bigger coins and an  ambitious dev team working hard. They have big goals such as Tesla burning at 50mil market cap and Lambo burning at 100mil market cap, also the fact that it's the first car based memecoin specifically focused on car guys can be extremely beneficial.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s78ixd6t71xc1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5c393d687cb0fa38e9fc2b06138f1e575d76e22\n\nLINU is the only community driven token. It is already listed on Bitmart and according to the admins big things are coming. Biggest green flag of this coin is its huge liquidity and holder count. The admin team is strong and I believe they will achieve many goals this bullrun.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8p38z5v361xc1.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6713c6e2fec9ba28fd7abf201cd4bebc04ba2ca7\n\nSo, what do you think about these coins? Feel free to discuss other tokens under this post. I find it interesting to find out different information about memecoins so if you have some leave a comment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

When something bad happens people should BUY not SELL because bitcoin is SECURE, can be transferred at anytime and is not tracked. Are you gonna use cash when your government is in a crisis? No, you use bitcoin because it isn't just paper which can be printed until infinity. Yesterday Iran launched some drones at Israel as a response to the bombardment of it's embassy in Syria. Think about it, it isn't even like WW3 is going to happen, and if it does are you going to use your paper money which inherently only has value because the government tells you so? Bitcoin should be pumping during uncertainty or crisis, not dumping. It's an uncontrolled, safe alternative for cash and a no weight alternative for gold which can't just be stolen from you like the cash and gold.",

Only 10% of my portfolio can be crypto unless it’s grandfathered it from before. I’m currently at about 90%. Microstrategies is currently overlooked however…but I really don’t know if that’s a similar enough investment to take opportunity.\n\nI have a couple options \n\n1. Hold my Bitcoin through all the ups and downs for long term and have it all tax free gains\n\n2. Sell portions to get profits hoping to buy back into Microstrategies at a lower price and build more up along the way\n\n3. Sell all for a really solid profit, hold that until the price comes back down in the next sip and buy real Bitcoin for cold storage, but then any gains I will be hit with capital gains tax going forward\n\n\n\nAny advice? \n",

    "title": "ETHDam Approaches, Underlines Privacy as the Game-changer Narrative to Boost Altcoin Performance",
    "selftext": "There is no dearth of altcoins calling for attention. But how to know which ones to back? Imminent Bitcoin halving and bullish market sentiments can only take you so far. Only a robust narrative that will transform the crypto and web3 space can translate into a rewarding success story. Oasis Network stands tall with its cutting-edge smart privacy solutions that touch almost every aspect of web3 - DeFi, AI, account abstraction, SocialFi, even DAOs, web3 gaming, and NFTs.\n\nThe renewed focus on privacy is aligned with the Oasis mission and vision of a uniquely scalable, privacy-first, and versatile web3 through confidential computation and the use of trusted execution environments. This has gelled so well with crypto AI that recently Oasis ([native token - ROSE](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/oasis-network/)) was lauded by crypto.com as one of the [top 10 AI tokens to know in 2024](https://crypto.com/university/top-10-ai-tokens). Oasis, however, continues to emphasize privacy as the underlying narrative that enables the better, safer web3 experience for everyone. Its participation and role as a sponsor in worldwide blockchain events also demonstrates this. \n\nAfter the roaring success of ETHDenver, Oasis is now prepping for ETHDam. In between, it made its presence quietly yet strongly felt at the inaugural ETHBucharest edition (catch the [highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0LADlKhCQ) here). Since then, Oasis has also been named as one of the official [sponsors of the dAppCon](https://twitter.com/dappcon_berlin/status/1775531931930611991) at Berlin later this year. However, ETHDam remains special as Oasis is the [main sponsor](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/oasis-at-ethdam-main-sponsorship) along with the event host - CryptoCanal. \n\nThe [3-day event](https://oasisprotocol.org/ethdam-2024) is scheduled for April 12-14. Oasis Technical Product Manager, Harry Roberts is the keynote speaker at the Grote Zaal - ETHDam Main Stage on April 12 which precedes the privacy panel talk featuring some stalwarts from the blockchain world. One of the star attractions of ETHDam this year is the hackathon organized by Oasis. The bounty is a generous $10k prize pool inviting projects to leverage Oasis's confidential Sapphire EVM features like private storage, RNG, encryption, key generation, and signing.\n\nWith less than a week to go before ETHDam starts, Oasis Software Engineer, Matevz Jekovec recently conducted an [in-depth workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZo32OljWs8) for Solidity devs and dApp builders. While it is true only hardcore and tech-savvy altcoin enthusiasts could appreciate the detailed learning resources and tooling, the key takeaway was its immense helpfulness for prospective hackathon participants at ETHDam. \n\nThere are also surprises waiting at ETHDam 2024. Prominent among these is when Oasis fulfills its promise of a grand revelation of its brand refresh that will underline its position as the leading voice of web3 privacy. Also, extending ETHDam beyond the Grote Zaal by taking it across Amsterdam, several other Ethereum-based and privacy-focused workshops, networking events, etc are planned and will soon be announced. \n\nSo, if you are a privacy maxi or count yourself among hackers, crypto natives, and creators in an EVM ecosystem, come and join ETHDam for three exciting days, starting April 12!

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I've been closely following the evolution of DeFi platforms and stumbled upon something pretty exciting—Velar is on its way to launching the world's first perpetual DEX built on Bitcoin. This could be a game-changer, right?  \nThe idea of a perpetual DEX isn't just new; it's revolutionary. Think about it: combining the security and robustness of Bitcoin with the endless possibilities of DeFi. Velar is aiming to bridge these two worlds, potentially opening up a whole new realm of trading strategies and opportunities that were previously confined to traditional finance or not possible due to the limitations of existing blockchain infrastructures.  \nWhat intrigues me the most is how they plan to tackle the common DeFi issues like liquidity and security. Plus, operating on Bitcoin could bring a level of stability and trust that's hard to find in the current Ethereum-dominated DeFi space. But I have questions—how will they ensure deep liquidity? What mechanisms are in place to protect users against the inherent volatility?  \nWould love to hear your thoughts on this. Could Velar's approach to perpetual DEXs on Bitcoin be the breakthrough we've been waiting for in DeFi?  \n[https://twitter.com/VelarBTC](https://twitter.com/VelarBTC)\n\n  \n[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/velar](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/velar)\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

    "selftext": "**Bitcoin will peak at 9369K USD in July 2025. Here is why (or not).**\n\nIn honour of all the \"Bitcoin's price will be ..... and here is why\", and a quiet Sunday afternoon in search of hopium, here you go. This is not financial advice. Anything you do is your own responsibility. Losses, including but not limited to savings, your wife (or other SO), etc., are your responsibility. In the event of wife (or other SO) changing money, they have no call on me either.\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/JT6eCNw7/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/JT6eCNw7/)\n\nHistory rhymes, right?\n\nThe important facts are:\n\n* Bitcoin breaks the ATH-to-bear-market-bottom 0.786 retracement 700 days after the final bear market capitulation.\n* The time to ATH from the start of the bull market is around 914 days\n* The ATH is at or a bit above the 2.272 retracement\n* Covid19 mangled the 2017 to 2021 cycle (more of this later).\n\nIn the 2013 to 2017 cycle the final bear market capitulation was Jan 2015, and the 0.786 was broken in Dec 2016 which is 700 days later. The bull market starts about Sep 2015 and the ATH follows about 850 days later at the 2.214 retracement.\n\nIn the 2017 to 2021 cycle the final bear market capitulation was Nov 2018 (it dropped a bit further but Nov was the killer month), and the 0.786 was broken in Oct 2020 which is 700 days later (it was touched in Jun 2019 but pulled back). The bull market starts about Apr 2019 (the April Fool's day candle) and the ATH follows about 914 days later (so a bit longer).\n\n**But**, the top is lower, what happened? Covid19 happened. After the price crash in Mar 2020, price recovered, then the money printers started as governments round the world tried to fix the total cluster f\\*\\*k which were the pandemic lockdowns. The result was a whole lot of people ended up with surplus fiat - think the laptop classes with stimulus cheques or furlough payments, with much less opportunity to spend, and so on. So, pay off some debt, save some fiat, invest .... and take a punt on crypto, it's free money after all. When the bull market really took hold, a lot of retail was already way in profit, so much less FOMO.\n\nSo, what should the top have been? Well, it should have been over 200K: the 2.272 retracement is at 210K give-to-take.\n\nNow, lets look at the current cycle. The capitulation event is Jun 2022 (Terra/Luna collapse - the FTX crash is not the same), so the 0.786 retracement break should not have been until May 2024 - but it has happened, in Feb 2024.\n\nWell, rather than say \"this time is different on account of the ETFs\", which means two \"different\" events (Covid19 and the ETFs) lets apply Occam's Razor, and assume only one \"different\" event, namely the one that has already happened, Covid19. In that case, we adjust the 2021 to 2025 cycle retracement to set the top at 216K which would be the 2.272 retracement \"top\" on the prior cycle plus a bit. This looks about right, the 0.786 retracement is now at about 115K which looks plausible given the current momentum.\n\nIn that case, the next ATH will be around Jul 2015 (912 days from the capitulation) and at around 940K (the 2.272 retracement).\n\nSo, there you have it. Feel free to congratulate me, or deride me, July next year.",

Would the value of Bitcoin cave in or would the value of Bitcoin go to infinity?

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've been following the discussions around Bitcoin's scripting language, and I stumbled upon something intriguing: the proposal to bring back OP_CAT, a previously deactivated opcode. It got me thinking about the potential implications for Bitcoin's future.\n\nSo, what do you all think about OP_CAT? On one hand, it seems like a powerful tool that could unlock new possibilities for smart contracts and enhance Bitcoin's functionality. But I've also heard some concerns about its past issues with script size and potential risks.\n\nFrom what I understand, OP_CAT enables the concatenation of two values on the stack, which could lead to more expressive scripts and innovative applications like decentralized file hosting and improved multi-signature schemes.\n\nBut I'm curious about the downsides too. Some folks have mentioned worries about script inflation and community divides over its adoption.\n\nI've seen examples of OP_CAT in action, like in Bitcoin Cash and Liquid BTC, where it's been used to improve scaling and enable smarter signatures.\n\nOverall, I'm wondering if the benefits outweigh the risks and if the reintroduction of OP_CAT could truly be a game-changer for Bitcoin.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Let's discuss! 🚀🔮",

    "selftext": "TL;DR at the end. \nI run a small construction LLC in TX as a side hustle. Good news is, things have really picked up for me and I’m considering going full time!\n\nBut before I do, I need to get all my ducks in a row. One of those ducks is receiving client payment.\n\nTo give you an idea of the size of my operation right now - I don’t really consider taking on work unless the job totals $40,000 or more. This is the average cost of a small / medium kitchen remodel in my area. \n\nIf I take on a job for $40,000 I’ll likely have at least 2 invoices to send to the client. The initial 50% deposit for $20,000 to buy materials and pay subcontractors, and the remaining $20,000 upon completion. (It’s never this simple, but dumbing it down for the sake of discussion)\n\nHere’s the problem: when a client pays an invoice digitally (95% of them want to… nobody really carries check books anymore), that $20,000 takes 7-10 business days to hit my account. \n\nThis means that I have to convince my client to pay me $20,000 almost 1 month before I step foot on the job (2 weeks for the payment to clear and 2 weeks to gather materials, pay subs, etc.)\n\nSo….. can crypto payments help remedy this? Is there an actual use case for receiving large payments instantaneously? The more user friendly, the higher likelihood my clients will get on board. \n\nI do not wish to hold crypto as a business, but rather USE crypto as a means of fast USD payments. I also really want to support and grow the crypto community. \n\nI also am having a difficult time finding wallets that I can set up as a BUSINESS. I have to keep my business and personal finances separate. If I don’t, it negates the point of operating an LLC. \n\nStrike on the Lightning Network seemed promising. Their app allows users to send and receive cash just like Venmo but it uses the BTC Lightning Network. \n\n*Client Sends USD&gt; Strike converts USD to BTC&gt;Lightning Transfer of BTC to Merchant &gt; Strike automatically Converts BTC back to USD &gt; Merchant receives USD*\n\nSad thing is… Strike has daily limits that fall well short of the $20,000 example. I looked into Cash App but it has the same limitations. \n\nA quick fix for me is to sign up for “instantaneous payment” in QuickBooks… but the fees are hard to swallow. In the $20,000 example, I’d have to pay QB $300 for an “instantaneous payment”. Like I mentioned earlier, I really want to support the crypto community any way I can. \n\nAny and all help on coming up with a solution would be appreciated! \n\nTL;DR\nIs there a crypto payment system I can use for receiving large transactions ($10K-$20K at a time) for business? The more user friendly, the higher likelihood my clients will get on board. ",

    "selftext": "On the 10th January 2024, history was made when the SEC granted the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the USA. The SEC was reluctant to approve the ETFs because, if you take them for their word, they wish to protect investors from speculative assets and losing money. So their statement of approval contained words of caution: “bitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset.” and “Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto”.\n\nIn this post I want to focus on the SEC’s warning that Bitcoin, and crypto in general, is a high risk investment. In isolation, that statement may be true. But plenty of tradable assets, approved by the SEC, are also considered ‘risky’. I couldn’t find SEC statements warning against investing in specific assets besides Bitcoin. So the implication here is that Bitcoin is especially risky, to the extent that investors should be warned against it so they do not lose money.\n\nAs a fun and informative exercise, I made four comparisons to highlight the relative risk of bitcoin vs tech stocks:\n\n1. The worst investments anyone could have made ever\n\n1. The worst investments from the most recent market crash\n\n1. The largest market cap loss\n\n1. ROI loss per day, historically and recently\n\nThis is a long post and I want to point out that if you appreciate clear data and objective analysis you might want to check out [DefiDive.com](https://defidive.com).

Worst Investment Possible: Crypto vs Tech Stocks**\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/zvbxSYz.png\n\n\nAsset | Start Date | End Date | Start Price | End Price | $100 bought at top and sold at bottom was worth | ROI %\n---|---|----|----|----|----|----\n| Alphabet (GOOGL) | Oct-2007 | Nov-2008 | $35.35 | $12.37 | $35 | -65% |\n| Microsoft | Dec-1999 | Feb-2009 | $59.97 | $16.10 | $27 | -73% |\n| Tesla | Nov-2021 | Dec-2022 | $414.50 | $108.24 | $26 | -74% |\n| Meta | Aug-2021 | Oct-2022 | $382.76 | $92.60 | $24 | -76% |\n| Netflix | May-2011 | Aug-2012 | $39.00 | $8.00 | $21 | -79% |\n| Apple | Mar-2000 | Apr-2003 | $1.34 | $0.23 | $17 | -83% |\n| Nvidia | Dec-2001 | Sep-2002 | $5.58 | $0.70 | $13 | -87% |\n| Zoom | Nov-2020 | Oct-2023 | $505.88 | $58.87 | $12 | -88% |\n| Bitcoin | Jun-2011 | Nov-2011 | $26.48 | $2.33 | $9 | -91% |\n| Ethereum | Jan-2018 | Dec-2018 | $1,292.63 | $84.47 | $7 | -93% |\n| Amazon | Apr-1999 | Sep-2001 | $5.53 | $0.28 | $5 | -95% |\n| AMD | Jan-2006 | Sep-2015 | $42.01 | $1.65 | $4 | -96% |\n| Peloton | Dec-2020 | Feb-2024 | $167.37 | $3.96 | $2 | -98% |\n\nThe worst investment possible in Bitcoin returned a -91% ROI and in Ethereum -93% ROI. In contrast, the ‘least worst’ investment is Alphabet with -65% ROI, the median investment is  Nvidia with -87% ROI, and the worst investment possible is Peoloton with -98% ROI. Bitcoin and Ethereum have produced bad losses for anyone buying the top and selling the bottom, but other tech stocks (Amazon, AMD, Peloton) have delivered worse ROI for unlucky investors.\n\nIt is worth noting that the market cap of Bitcoin in 2011 was $173MM vs Google in 2007 was $231B. In other words, Bitcoin was worth 0.07% of Google. Comparing Bitcoin’s market crash vs publicly traded tech stocks puts Bitcoin at a disadvantage because these tech stocks only have tradable shares once the company has grown to be large enough to list on a stock market. For example, Google was founded six years before becoming a publicly traded stock in 2004. Bitcoin became publicly tradable within a year of creation and Ethereum was publicly tradable from the moment it was launched. Ultimately we are comparing Bitcoin at age two years old, Ethereum three years old, and Google nine years old. It is reasonable to expect higher volatility from newer and smaller assets.\n\n\n**2. Worst Recent Investments: Crypto vs Tech Stocks**\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/akl87Jk.png\n\nAsset | Start Date | End Date | Start Price | End Price | $100 bought at top and sold at bottom was worth | ROI %\n---|---|----|----|----|----|----\n| Apple | Dec-2021 | Dec-2022 | $182.13 | $125.87 | $69 | -31% |\n| Microsoft | Dec-2021 | Oct-2022 | $344.30 | $219.13 | $64 | -36% |\n| Alphabet (GOOG) | Oct-2021 | Dec-2022 | $149.12 | $86.37 | $58 | -42% |\n| Amazon | Nov-2021 | Dec-2022 | $188.11 | $81.69 | $43 | -57% |\n| Nvidia | Nov-2021 | Sep-2022 | $346.47 | $119.46 | $34 | -66% |\n| AMD | Nov-2021 | Oct-2022 | $164.46 | $54.57 | $33 | -67% |\n| Tesla | Nov-2021 | Dec-2022 | $414.50 | $108.24 | $26 | -74% |\n| Bitcoin | Nov-2021 | Nov-2022 | $64,158.12 | $15,883.16 | $25 | -75% |\n| Meta | Aug-2021 | Oct-2022 | $382.76 | $92.60 | $24 | -76% |\n| Netflix | Oct-2021 | Jun-2022 | $690.97 | $164.28 | $24 | -76% |\n| Ethereum | Nov-2021 | Jul-2022 | $4,733.36 | $1,036.19 | $22 | -78% |\n| Zoom | Nov-2020 | Oct-2023 | $505.88 | $58.87 | $12 | -88% |\n| Peloton | Dec-2020 | Feb-2024 | $167.37 | $3.96 | $2 | -98% |\n\nInstead of using data from an asset’s entire history, this table compares the worst investments possible during the most recent market crash. All of the assets reached their respective bubble tops and market crashes at slightly different times, and Peloton might not have bottomed out yet. Bitcoin was the sixth worst asset and Ethereum was the third. This tells the same narrative that crypto investments can produce bad returns, but not necessarily much different from tech stocks.\n\n**3. Market Cap Loss: Crypto vs Tech Stocks**\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/gZ0bHUf.png\n\nAsset | Start Date | End Date | Start Market Cap | End Market Cap | Value Destroyed\n---|---|----|----|----|----|----\n| Peloton | Jan-2021 | Feb-2024 | $48,341,000,000 | $1,665,600,000 | -$46,675,400,000 |\n| AMD | Nov-2021 | Oct-2022 | $195,524,200,000 | $90,305,100,000 | -$105,219,100,000 |\n| Zoom | Oct-2020 | Feb-2024 | $161,647,800,000 | $18,910,800,000 | -$142,737,000,000 |\n| Netflix | Jan-2022 | Nov-2022 | $729,473,500,000 | $313,861,300,000 | -$415,612,200,000 |\n| Ethereum | Nov-2021 | Jul-2022 | $559,910,000,000 | $126,170,000,000 | -$433,740,000,000 |\n| Nvidia | Nov-2021 | Oct-2022 | $835,067,500,000 | $279,552,300,000 | -$555,515,200,000 |\n| Meta | Sep-2021 | Nov-2022 | $1,077,535,300,000 | $235,749,200,000 | -$841,786,100,000 |\n| Tesla | Nov-2021 | Jan-2023 | $1,235,155,400,000 | $341,353,000,000 | -$893,802,400,000 |\n| Bitcoin | Nov-2021 | Nov-2022 | $1,210,000,000,000 | $305,020,000,000 | -$904,980,000,000 |\n| Alphabet (GOOG) | Nov-2021 | Nov-2022 | $1,997,397,915,765 | $1,076,770,529,999 | -$920,627,385,766 |\n| Microsoft | Nov-2021 | Nov-2022 | $2,576,063,200,000 | $1,597,120,900,000 | -$978,942,300,000 |\n| Apple | Jan-2022 | Jan-2023 | $2,986,128,300,000 | $1,989,628,300,000 | -$996,500,000,000 |\n| Amazon | Jul-2021 | Dec-2022 | $1,875,751,400,000 | $847,145,400,000 | -$1,028,606,000,000 |\n\nTo avoid penalising assets just for being small, comparing the maximum market cap lost is another useful perspective. Amazon is the only asset to lose over $1 Trillion in value. Ethereum performs better than an average for the first time in this analysis. The ranking of this table suggests Bitcoin is comparable to Big Tech, while Ethereum is comparable to the large cap tech.\n\nBy none of the measures studied so far has Bitcoin or Ethereum performed the worst. Some might argue that perhaps the risk in crypto comes from the speed at which an investor might lose money. So the following analysis looks at ROI % loss per day during market crashes.\n\n**4. ROI Loss per Day: Crypto vs Tech Stocks** \n\nAll-time worst market crash comparison:\n\nAsset | Start Date | Crash Length (Days) | Average % change per Day \n---|---|----|----|----|----|----\n| Microsoft | Dec-1999 | 3350 | -0.02% |\n| AMD | Jan-2006 | 3530 | -0.03% |\n| Apple | Mar-2000 | 1126 | -0.07% |\n| Zoom | Nov-2020 | 1064 | -0.08% |\n| Peloton | Dec-2020 | 1157 | -0.08% |\n| Amazon | Apr-1999 | 884 | -0.11% |\n| Alphabet (GOOGL) | Oct-2007 | 397 | -0.16% |\n| Netflix | May-2011 | 458 | -0.17% |\n| Meta | Aug-2021 | 426 | -0.18% |\n| Tesla | Nov-2021 | 395 | -0.19% |\n| Ethereum | Jan-2018 | 334 | -0.28% |\n| Nvidia | Dec-2001 | 274 | -0.32% |\n| Bitcoin | Jun-2011 | 153 | -0.60% |\n\nBitcoin lost -0.60% per day (average, non-compounding) during the 2011 crash. Which is almost twice as the next worst asset, Nvidia. However, we already established that Bitcoin was so small in 2011 that we aren’t making a fair comparison here. In the most recent market crash, Bitcoin’s ROI loss per day was -0.21%, which is similar to other tech stocks (see next table below)\n\nMost recent market crash comparison:\n\nAsset | Start Date | Crash Length (Days) | Average % change per Day \n---|---|----|----|----|----|----\n| Zoom | Nov-2020 | 1064 | -0.08% |\n| Peloton | Dec-2020 | 1157 | -0.08% |\n| Apple | Dec-2021 | 365 | -0.08% |\n| Alphabet (GOOG) | Oct-2021 | 426 | -0.10% |\n| Microsoft | Dec-2021 | 304 | -0.12% |\n| Amazon | Nov-2021 | 395 | -0.14% |\n| Meta | Aug-2021 | 426 | -0.18% |\n| Tesla | Nov-2021 | 395 | -0.19% |\n| AMD | Nov-2021 | 334 | -0.20% |\n| Bitcoin | Nov-2021 | 365 | -0.21% |\n| Nvidia | Nov-2021 | 304 | -0.22% |\n| Netflix | Oct-2021 | 243 | -0.31% |\n| Ethereum | Nov-2021 | 242 | -0.32% |\n\nIn the most recent crash Ethereum lost -0.32% per day (average non-compounding). That is clearly the worst result here, but only one percentage point worse than Netflix. It is somewhat impressive that Zoom and Peloton have the lowest average ROI loss per day, but that is limited comfort to investors if the stock price never recovers. Objectively, with Ethereum already rebounding from $1.1K in Dec-22 to $3.9K in Mar-24, Ethereum has been a better investment than Peloton even if you did get rekt along the way.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOut of everything I have studied (not all of which made it into the final cut of this blog post), I find this graph the most useful for summarising potential losses when investing in crypto and tech stocks:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/akl87Jk.png\n\nLooking back at the SEC’s statement, it does seem unfair to single Bitcoin out as a volatile asset when Bitcoin performed similarly to commonly traded tech stocks during the most recent market crash. It feels like the SEC statement is talking about Bitcoin’s volatility as if it is 2011. If we were to take the SEC’s statement as gospel, we would expect this analysis to show Bitcoin and Ethereum are significantly more risky than tech stocks. Instead Bitcoin performed similarly to other tech stocks during the recent market crash and Ethereum performed not much worse. \n\n**A Sidenote on Beta**\n\nBeta is a measure of an asset's correlation to the broader market. This can be used as a proxy for measuring risk. Tech stocks have become so large that they effectively become ‘the broader market’. You can see below they all have betas close to one. In other words, if big tech share prices go up (or down), so does the S&amp;P 500. Crypto has little correlation to the S&amp;P 500, partly because it has outperformed it over the past 14 years. This gives crypto a beta close to 0, which effectively means anything or nothing could happen when the S&amp;P 500 rises or falls. The beta for crypto has increased since 2020 but it is still far away from other tech stocks. In practice, this means that crypto could be considered as a method to diversify away from tech stocks / S&amp;P 500. Ironically, you could make the argument that this helps lower the overall risk of a portfolio if someone invests sensibly into crypto to achieve more diversification.\n\nAsset | Beta | Interpretation |\n---|---|----|----|----|----|----\n| Ethereum | 0.08 | The asset’s price movements are independent of market movements. |\n| Bitcoin | 0.20 | The asset’s price movements are independent of market movements. |\n| Microsoft | 0.95 | If the market goes up or down by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to move in the same direction by a similar percentage. |\n| Alphabet (GOOGL) | 1.05 | If the market goes up or down by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to move in the same direction by a similar percentage. |\n| Apple | 1.06 | If the market goes up or down by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to move in the same direction by a similar percentage. |\n| Amazon | 1.12 | If the market goes up or down by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to move in the same direction by a similar percentage. |\n| Netflix | 1.15 | If the market goes up or down by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to move in the same direction by a similar percentage. |\n| Meta | 1.34 | If the market increases by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to increase by a higher percentage, and vice versa. |\n| Zoom | 1.36 | If the market increases by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to increase by a higher percentage, and vice versa. |\n| AMD | 1.48 | If the market increases by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to increase by a higher percentage, and vice versa. |\n| Nvidia | 1.78 | If the market increases by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to increase by a higher percentage, and vice versa. |\n| Tesla | 1.95 | If the market increases by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to increase by a higher percentage, and vice versa. |\n| Peloton | 2.84 | If the market increases by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to increase by a higher percentage, and vice versa. |",

I've been in and out of Shiba Inu and xyo a couple of times and made a small profit. I'm into xyo at just over 0.013, I think. And into Shiba Inu at if I remember correctly 0.000034.\n\nThey are both down from those positions. A lesson I learned early on that has done me well is that it's not a loss until you sell.

    "selftext": "The higher the price of Bitcoin climbs, the more FUD we should expect to see.  Keep in mind: the people spreading FUD don't necessarily believe what they're saying.  They often have ulterior motives.  Here's a perfect example.\n\nJim Cramer was doing a small on camera interview that he never thought anyone would see.  He admitted creating false information to cause the price of certain stocks to drop.\n\n&gt; Cramer: \"A lot of times when I was short at my hedge fund, and I was position short, meaning I needed it down, I would create a level of activity before hand that could drive the futures. It doesn't take much money.\"\n\n&gt; Cramer: \"Now you can't foment. That's a violation of, of...\"\n\n&gt; Interviewer: \"Ferment?\"\n\n&gt; Cramer: \"You can't FOment. You can't create, yourself, an impression that a stock's down. But you do it anyway because the SEC doesn't understand it. So, I mean that's the only sense I would say this is illegal.\"\n\nHere's the whole thing:\n\nFuck Jim Cramer, [Part 1: \"How the hell did we end up here?\"](https://www.cc.com/video/fttmoj/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-exclusive-jim-cramer-extended-interview-pt-1)\n\nFuck Jim Cramer, [Part 2: Cramer Admits Fraud and \"Roll 212\"](https://www.cc.com/video/iinzrx/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-jim-cramer-pt-2)\n\nFuck Jim Cramer, [Part 3: \"What is the responsibility of people who cover Wall Street?\"](https://www.cc.com/video/gliow5/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-jim-cramer-pt-3)\n\nAt one point in the interview, Jon Stewart showed Cramer video of himself (Cramer) admitting to committing fraud.  In the video Steward showed Cramer, Cramer said: \"...that's the part that's illegal\" and \"...I'm not gonna say that on TV.\"\n\nCramer's response: \"It's on TV now!\"\n\nCramer is a fraud.  Always has been, always will be.\n\nIn this example, Cramer wasn't talking about Bitcoin.  But he was explaining how he, and others like him, spread lies to force prices lower (so he can profit).\n\nRemember: When you see Bitcoin FUD, the person spreading it probably doesn't even believe what he's saying.\n\nHere's [more](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/lg0ial/jim_cramer_explains_how_he_manipulated_the_market/gmoyqj5/) of the original Cramer interview where he admitted committing fraud.",

    "selftext": "Hey YALL,\n\nFirst I’d like to say my spidey senses are tingling  and the alarm bells are ringing on overtime; and I’m calling the top here (within this 72 hour period). The bitcoin top has been breached at 67.8k, and if another big day it’ll be 68.9kish by Wednesday which will mark the absolute top. For the first time in ages I have begun to take profits and rebalanced after buying heavy bags at 16-22k just in 2022. \n\nFor the first time ever I have arranged bitcoin shorts. Before anyone asks I rebalanced a small portion and am a bitcoin maxi. \n\nI’ve seen and been apart of each bitcoin since  bull and bear market of 2013. I know this post may not be popular and for many will hope I am wrong which I understand. Believe me I made many mistakes in my time. Please use cold storage, have dry powder ready, and do NOT ape into meme coins.. you’ll get through this. \n\nThis run has been impressive no doubt, and this rally is similar but more extreme than the 2019 bull trap.\n\nThe real winners will be the ones who don’t panic sell and buy bitcoin when it’s in the low 40’s this summer. Bitcoin will at least test the 200W. Remember 25-30% corrections is normal even in bull runs.\n\nHowever I would like for those to exercise caution (especially for those who have yet to experience the ups and downs in this market. Every indicator is screening this is the biggest bull trap possibly ever. Yes I get ETF’s are out and “this time is different” but remember as fast as retail and institutions buy they can sell. It is different per se in testing ATH before the halving, but the real bull market begins later this year. \n\nOnce the FED begins to cut rates this summer the market will drop and experience heavy volatility. The real euphoria will begin. 12-18 months with QE and liquidity. This was a mere warm up.\n\nDoesn’t mean I am a bear. I am an ultra bitcoin maxi, however short term we have hit tops for bitcoin within this cycle pre halving. I’ll see you late 2025-2026 when BTC is &gt;150k. By 2029-2032 over 1m. \n\nThe real bull market begins back in October, I will hibernate till then. You can remind me anytime in the summer if I was right or not.  Retail FOMO always gets burned. Be careful out there.\n\nI’m here to answer and support. ",

About 40 billion is traded today, so 20-25 is maybe bought. So 2-4 billion is 10-20% of the probable inflow into the BTC ETF's. Any thoughts on how a 10% higher inflow moves BTC?

    "selftext": "I’ve been researching bitcoin and this bitcoin halving cycle and came to some conclusions. \n\nCan someone play devils advocate or let me know if I’m wrong on any of these points? I know that there some veterans in this subreddit, and I’m hoping to get some other viewpoints to challenge my thesis: \n\n\n1. Nobody has ever lost money holding bitcoin for any rolling 4 year period \n\n2. In the last phase of each bull market cycle, bitcoin will have parabolic moves up, and then crashes hard, but never significantly goes below the all time high price of the last bull market cycle. For example, bitcoin reached an all time high of 65-70K in 2021, and then crashed 70-80% to around 16K in 2022 only for only a few weeks, but never stayed below the 20K all time high from 2017 for long. The 20K all time high from 2017 was basically the floor for the next cycle \n\nIf the 2021 high for bitcoin was 65-70K then that will be the floor for this bitcoin cycle. Bitcoin will have parabolic moves after this bitcoin halving event in April 2024, but after it inevitably reaches the next all time high and crashes it will not significantly fall under 65K. \nAnyone buying bitcoin at today’s prices will not lose money in the next Bear market and there’s still a large margin of safety \n\n3. What sets this bitcoin cycle apart from any other previous cycle is that SEC approved, regulated bitcoin spot ETFs exist now. Every previous cycle consisted of only retail investors, but now institutional investors have a regulated way to buy bitcoin. The institutional money should make bitcoin less volatile. \n\nAs bitcoin reaches higher and higher market caps we would also expect the price to be less volatile just like any maturing asset. \n\nThis bitcoin cycle or some future bitcoin cycle, people are going to expect bitcoin to eventually crash 70-80%, but bitcoin may only crash 20-40% due to institutional money and increasing adoption/awareness. When bitcoin only crashes 20-40% in the upcoming Bear markets then this will cause many traders to stumble, and will be validation for the bitcoin thesis as a mature asset \n\nAm I wrong on any of the three points above? Is anyone able to challenge my assumptions? I just don’t want to get wrecked next year \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/qanplatform/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/qanplatform/)   \n\n\nMy analysis, not financial advice.  You can see this one is down 60% from recent high, so not sharing this after it already took off.  This is not TA, and I wouldn't advise even trying TA with this one.\n\n\" On top of that, they have ensured evm compatibility, along with a private/hybrid/public design. With the ability to code in any language, this will be an easy choice for business to engage in blockchain solutions. They can start testing a privatenet for next to nothing just like the community devs did. \"  \n\n\nI lead in with the above because people think QANX is all about quantum resistance.  It's not- they certainly are prepared for it which you will be seeing all systems start doing this year.  So, it won't even be a feature in the longer term, it will be required to survive.  But, enough on that.  \n\n\nHere's why I see recent events as very bullish. \n\nQanplatform has long been seeking to deliver a chain that enables:\n\n\\- Smart contracts using any coding language\n\n\\- Signatures that implement post-quantum security\n\n\\- A royalty feature for reusable code\n\n\\- Consensus that aimed to improve upon Proof of Stake, which they termed Proof of Randomness\n\nThese are all considered IP in that they are protecting them until they build up market share before they will be open source with the mainnet.\n\nThey have proven they have a working product that delivers the top 2. In fact, community devs have been hosting their own privatenet where they are demonstrating the capabilities.\n\nOn top of that, they have ensured evm compatibility, along with a private/hybrid/public design. With the ability to code in any language, this will be an easy choice for business to engage in blockchain solutions. They can start testing a privatenet for next to nothing just like the community devs did.\n\nWith that, the team had a good year, landing nice partnerships and 15M financial backing from MBK. They also updated tokenomics to prepare for a proper mainnet, removing almost half the tokens that were allocated to the team/project work.\n\nSo, things were looking really good until they announced their testnet was delayed from previous expectations. Price fell over 60%, and my guess is mostly due to fear the mainnet would not arrive in time to take advantage of bull market/halving.\n\nWell, they now shared they will go to market using Proof of Stake, rather than the improved consensus they planned to use. For anyone paying attention, this is huge news! It tells me this:\n\n\\- There is an urgency to release the primary product\n\n\\- There is less risk as they don't have to \"prove\" the consensus\n\n\\- There may be other players recommending this approach, or important reasons they need to get going without delay.\n\nThey can always improve upon consensus as time goes on, just like btc, eth, and any other chain have done.\n\nI've followed this a long time, and of course am invested. I applaud this news. I've remained an investor primarily because I think they are delivering a product that businesses will be able to engage with quickly, without needing to justify major investments. They really have removed the barriers. And I've seen Johann the CTO in action, from being on stage with NIST and IBM, to navigating difficult times. They seem to bounce back stronger, and that tells me they have a product worth fighting for.\n\nFeel free to google qanplatform roadmap to learn more.\n\nOh, and there are quite a few things we are waiting on- improved liquidity/more exchanges, updates to various listings reflecting supply (they removed 1/3 of supply by taking almost half of the team allocated tokens.  Another major move to prepare for main), showcasing partner use of privatenet, etc.  All upside in my eyes.  Cheers",

I will list here everything that I used so far, looking forward to hearing your feedback... \n\nThe biggest portion of my earnings comes from just hodling, been in this space since late 2017, and still have ETH from 750$ per coin, and BTC from 3k per coin. I don't know trading, never understood charts and from my perspective I have true admiration for people who trade daily... Previous bull run, I used to stake [UTK](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/xmoney) (now xMoney) and [BNB](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bnb), didn't go so well, in fact I even managed to lose BNB from that wallet, not sure how, though. After that, I moved to staking [DOT](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/polkadot) and [ACH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/alchemy-pay), not happy with the gains since they dipped badly.\n\nEntire 2023 I staked [CVX](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/convex-finance) and used my right to vote for proposals, earned a bit of [FXS](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/frax-share) and USDC there, but nothing significant. \n\nAt the moment, I am exploring DAOs, and in all honesty, it is going well compared to staking but not as good as hodling. Using MKR to vote on [MakerDAO](https://gov.daomaker.com/#/) platform, but not for all proposals. Sometimes I delegate my right to other reputable individuals. Also I am on [DIA DAO](https://www.diadata.org/dao/), smaller community compared to Maker, but earnings are bigger although proportionally I hold the same amounts. 2 years ago I tried Compound also, but earnings weren't that good, didn't follow them lately.\n\nSo, there you have my passive income history.

    "title": "Unveiling the Potential of OP_CAT in Bitcoin: A Gateway to Magic or a Double-Edged Sword?",
    "selftext": "In the ever-evolving landscape of Bitcoin's scripting language, the proposal to reintroduce OP\\_CAT, a new tapscript opcode, has sparked considerable debate within the cryptocurrency community. This essay explores the intricacies of OP\\_CAT, its potential benefits for enhancing Bitcoin's functionality, and the counterarguments against its adoption. \r  \n\r  \n**What is OP\\_CAT ?**\n\n\r  \nAn opcode on Bitcoin called OP\\_CAT aids in increasing the range of operations that may be performed on the platform. Concatenate, which is an acronym for join or combine two objects in programming code, is what the CAT in OP\\_CAT stands for.\r  \n\r  \nPcodes allow the Bitcoin network to handle a variety of transaction types with varying sets of rules and circumstances. This ensures that the network remains stable and flexible to transactions.\r  \n\r  \n**This introduction sets the stage for exploring OP\\_CAT's potential in Bitcoin's scripting language, outlining its historical context, technical intricacies, and the divided opinions within the cryptocurrency community**\r  \n\r  \n**I. Understanding OP\\_CAT: A Concatenation Opcode**\r  \n\r  \nOP\\_CAT, short for \"concatenate,\" is a proposed opcode designed to allow the concatenation of two values on the stack in Bitcoin's scripting language. If activated, OP\\_CAT would facilitate the merging of two values, providing a versatile tool for developers to create more expressive and powerful smart contracts.\r  \n\r  \n**OP\\_CAT, aimed at concatenating values in Bitcoin's stack, could enhance script expressiveness, though its historical deactivation raises crucial security considerations.**\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n**II. The Promise of OP\\_CAT: Unlocking Bitcoin's Potential**\r  \n\r  \nExpressiveness and Power of Tapscript: Bitcoin tapscript currently lacks a general-purpose method for combining objects on the stack, limiting the expressiveness and power of tapscript. OP\\_CAT aims to overcome this limitation, offering a simple yet powerful opcode to concatenate stack values.\r  \n\r  \nExpanded Functionality: OP\\_CAT could significantly expand Bitcoin's capabilities by providing a general-purpose way to concatenate stack values. This opens the door to constructing and evaluating complex data structures, such as Merkle trees and hashed structures, within tapscript.\r  \n\r  \nUse Cases for OP\\_CAT: The proposed opcode introduces a myriad of potential use cases, ranging from enhancing atomic swaps for decentralized file hosting to enabling tree signatures, Post-Quantum Lamport Signatures, non-equivocation contracts, vaults, and replicating CheckSigFromStack for advanced contracts.\r  \n\r  \nIn the other hand, \"OP\\_CAT was one of the opcodes that Satoshi Nakamoto deactivated. This is because, by utilizing OP\\_DUP (duplicate) and OP\\_CAT (concatenate) to continuously put a 1-byte value onto the stack, the script size can grow to be more than 1 terabyte, which increases the likelihood of a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to a geometric growth in memory usage.\r  \n\r  \nNowadays, though, it's considered that this is not an issue because tapscript sets a 520 byte maximum for stack elements. As a result, OP\\_CAT has a BIP proposed.\r  \n\r  \nA universal mechanism for concatenating stack values is introduced by OP\\_CAT, which improves efficiency and expressiveness.\r  \nAs an illustration:\r  \nOne can limit currency usage by requiring a particular transaction. This entails requiring the same output script in order to link coins to a certain address. For example, \"If you sign this document, you can take up to 1 BTC from this output, and the rest must go to this change address.\" This precisely dictates which specific transaction templates are authorised. \r  \nStill, there are issues with OP\\_CAT as well. The effect that OP\\_CAT will have on the Bitcoin network is unknown, even with the 520-byte limit. Furthermore, users can write intricate scripts and conceal them behind a hash using the Pay to Script Hash (P2SH) feature of the Bitcoin scripting system. The full script is pushed onto the stack during P2SH transactions, and it is constrained to 520 bytes. bigger multi-signature scripts are so restricted, with n/15 serving as the highest limit for P2SH multi-signature scripts, thereby prohibiting the use of bigger multi-signature scripts.\r  \n\r  \n**This section highlights OP\\_CAT's promise in expanding Bitcoin's capabilities, with potential applications in complex data structures and advanced smart contracts.**\r  \n\r  \n**III. Arguments in Favor of OP\\_CAT: Building a Magical Bitcoin**\r  \n\r  \nInnovation in Smart Contracts: OP\\_CAT offers a tool for developers to innovate and create more sophisticated smart contracts, expanding the possibilities for decentralised applications on the Bitcoin blockchain.\r  \n\r  \nEfficiency and Simplification: The simplicity and modularity of OP\\_CAT align with the Unix philosophy, making it a valuable addition to the tapscript toolbox. It can simplify scripting, making it more accessible and efficient for developers.\r  \n\r  \nCost-Effective Solutions: The proposed opcode could potentially lead to cost-effective solutions for secure document signings and other applications, reducing the need for complex cryptographic techniques.\r  \n\r  \nFuture-Proofing with Quantum-Safe Measures: OP\\_CAT is designed with quantum-safe measures, ensuring that signatures on the blockchain remain secure even as technology advances, contributing to the future-proofing of Bitcoin.\r  \n\r  \n**Summarizing the favoring arguments, OP\\_CAT is seen as a tool for innovative smart contracts, efficiency, and quantum-safe measures, contributing to Bitcoin's future-proofing**\r  \n\r  \n**IV. Counterarguments Against OP\\_CAT: Navigating Potential Pitfalls**\r  \n\r  \nSecurity Concerns: The historical removal of OP\\_CAT in early Bitcoin versions due to potential memory usage issues raises valid security concerns. Careful mitigation strategies must be in place to prevent new vulnerabilities and potential denial-of-service attacks.\r  \n\r  \nScript Size Inflation: Uncontrolled use of OP\\_CAT could lead to larger scripts, consuming more resources and potentially impacting transaction fees. Measures to prevent abuse and optimise script execution are essential.\r  \n\r  \nCommunity Resistance: Implementing major changes like OP\\_CAT requires consensus within the Bitcoin community. Resistance may arise from those advocating for simpler, minimalist approaches and those concerned about potential risks.\r  \n\r  \nAlternative Softforks: Prioritising other softforks addressing core issues like scalability or privacy might be favored over introducing new functionalities like OP\\_CAT.\r  \n\r  \nIt's important to note that when discussing the potential reintroduction of OP\\_CAT, it's crucial to revisit its original deactivation in 2010. Satoshi Nakamoto made this decision, emphasising a precautionary approach that prioritised network security and stability over expansive scripting capabilities. The deactivation of OP\\_CAT was driven primarily by concerns about script-based vulnerabilities that could be exploited for Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. This decision underscores the early understanding of Bitcoin's scripting power and its potential security implications at that time.\r  \n\r  \n**The counterarguments emphasize concerns about security risks, script size inflation, community resistance, and prioritizing other core Bitcoin improvements.**\r  \n\r  \n**V. Different perspectives on enabling OP\\_CAT and Cryptocurrency**\r  \n\r  \nSeveral BIP proposals have been written regarding OP\\_CAT, including one by Ethan Heilman. First of all  the GitHub repository for Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) is a comprehensive collection of documents proposing changes and improvements to Bitcoin. Each BIP is a separate file, usually named with a specific BIP number, and contains detailed information about a proposed change, including its purpose, design, and potential impact. The repository serves as a central reference point for developers and participants in the Bitcoin community to understand, discuss, and contribute to the ongoing evolution of Bitcoin.\r  \n\r  \nThe draft of Heilmann addresses OP\\_CAT's history, its previous deactivation, and proposes measures to mitigate past issues. It aims to enhance Bitcoin's scripting capabilities, emphasising OP\\_CAT's potential in various applications. The draft provides a detailed technical overview and rationale for its reintroduction. The proposal:\r  \n\r  \n\\- Revisits the historical context and utility of OP\\_CAT in early Bitcoin versions.\r  \n\\- Addresses the security concerns that led to its deactivation.\r  \n\\- Proposes safeguards to prevent these issues in its reintroduction.\r  \n\\- Discusses how OP\\_CAT can expand Bitcoin's scripting capabilities and the potential applications it enables.\r  \n\r  \nFurthermore in May 2015, Bitcoin Cash implemented an update that included the addition of various opcodes, including OP\\_CAT. Unlike btc core, certain opcodes like OP\\_CAT are active in BCH. Blockstream is a company that develops products and services related to storage and transfer, among other things, of BTC. They explored the capabilities of OP\\_CAT in their Alpha script. \r  \n\r  \nOne discovery was related to scaling. The update made it possible to achieve a logarithmic scaling method, doubling the number of valid public keys with a constant increase of 40 bytes. In comparison, in BTC, adding a separate public key is equivalent to 34 bytes. Also, there was an examination of the relationship between Merkle trees and Schnorr signatures using opcodes. It was found that it was possible to create single large combinations of M-of-N multisig. So the use of opcodes can contribute to more efficiency and streamlining on BTC.\r  \n\r  \nLiquid BTC is a Bitcoin layer-2 solution enabling fast, confidential settlement &amp; issuance of digital assets. Like BTH, Liquid BTC also has OP\\_CAT, along with other features such as CSFS and 30 additional helper opcodes. This development was discussed in more detail in connection with CheckTemplateVerify (CTV) and Bitcoin development on X by some experts. Their conclusions: \r  \n\r  \n\\- CTV's Functionality and Implementation: There's a focus on the potential and limitations of CTV in enhancing Bitcoin's programmability and scalability.\r  \n\\- Governance and Consensus Building: The conversation reflects on how changes in Bitcoin are proposed, debated, and potentially implemented, highlighting the community-driven nature of decision-making.\r  \n\\- Security and Misuse Concerns: Discussions about the risk of government misuse of multisig wallets and the potential for recursive covenants to be used nefariously.\r  \n\\- Technical Innovations vs. Centralization Risks: Balancing the need for technological advancements in Bitcoin with the ethos of decentralization and security.\n\n\r  \nIn addition an email from 2022 discusses the challenges and potential solutions for getting soft fork ideas, like opcodes variations, from concept to deployment in the Bitcoin network. The author, aj at erisian.com.au, proposes the concept of \"bitcoin-inquisition\" to facilitate this process. The process is a complex one that requires technical excellence, community consensus, and a deep understanding of the network's fundamental principles. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \nAlso it’s important to maintain decentralization in the evaluation process of soft fork proposals in Bitcoin. The email proposes an alternative approach that involves multiple phases. This approach aims to avoid the centralization of decision-making and ensure that the Bitcoin network remains trust-minimized and decentralized. \r  \n\r  \nFurther the email suggests that one way to make it easier is to demonstrate a soft fork's functionality and benefits is to deploy it on the default global Signet as soon as it has a fully specified proposal and a high-quality implementation. However, it also acknowledges the challenge of merging the code into Bitcoin Core before thorough evaluation(conundrum), leading to the proposal of the \"bitcoin-inquisition\" fork as a potential solution to this conundrum. The solution is called \"bitcoin-inquisition.\" This fork would branch from stable releases of Bitcoin Core and add support for proposed consensus changes, such as CheckTemplateVerify (CTV), AnyPrevout (APO), Taproot (TLUV), OP\\_CAT, etc. So the \"bitcoin-inquisition\" fork facilitates the testing and evaluation of proposed changes in a controlled environment before they are considered for inclusion in the main Bitcoin Core software.\r  \n\r  \nAfterward successful testing with the help of \"bitcoin-inquisition\" fork. The email provides a framework for developers to work on these changes, like newly implemented opcodes, test them on Signet, and collaborate to ensure their quality and suitability before potential integration into the main Bitcoin Core software. Soft forks could result in challenges while making improvements to the Bitcoin protocol. Important is to avoid hard forks and network disruptions. So the email suggests an Abandonment Mechanism. This mechanism allows a soft fork to be abandoned if it is deemed necessary.\r  \n\r  \nAlso the quality of the code is important, some criteria may not be met. Contributions, reviews, and community participation are encouraged to influence and maintain the development standards of this specialized fork. High-quality code and thorough testing are essential to ensure the reliability of the evaluation and testing environment for proposed soft forks.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nThe following step after the testing, on the \"bitcoin-inquisition\" fork and Signet, is to base \"bitcoin-inquisition\" on stable releases of Bitcoin Core. This choice is driven by the desire to minimize code conflicts, facilitate backporting, ensure stability, and provide a reliable starting point for developers involved in the evaluation and testing of proposed consensus changes within the fork. \r  \n\r  \nFinally it’s important to avoid centralisation and undue influence in the context of \"bitcoin-inquisition\" and its role in evaluating soft forks. Decentralised principles should be maintained. The miners or maintainers of \"bitcoin-inquisition\" should not have the ability to unduly promote or block proposals without community consensus. The goal is to preserve the peer-to-peer nature of the Bitcoin network throughout the evaluation and testing process.  In conclusion, the email discusses a comprehensive process as a means to activate Op\\_CAT.\r  \n\r  \nHowever Senator Elizabeth Warren expresses deep skepticism about cryptocurrencies in general. Her concerns center on the lack of transparency and regulation in the crypto industry, contrasting it with the established regulatory framework of traditional banking. Warren's comments reflect broader regulatory and societal concerns about the rapid growth and volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, the potential for misuse, and the challenges in integrating them into the existing financial system. Her stance signals a call for more robust regulatory measures to ensure consumer protection and financial stability in the face of this emerging technology.\r  \n\r  \n**This section examines the varied perspectives on OP\\_CAT, including BIP proposals, community discussions, and implications for Bitcoin's development.**\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n**VI. Conclusion: Striking a Balance in Bitcoin's Evolution**\r  \n\r  \nIn conclusion, the potential reintroduction of OP\\_CAT into Bitcoin's scripting language presents both exciting opportunities and valid concerns. Striking a balance between innovation and security, between expanded functionality and potential drawbacks, is crucial. As Bitcoin continues to evolve, community consensus and careful consideration of the trade-offs will determine whether OP\\_CAT becomes a magical tool in shaping the future of Bitcoin or a potential challenge that requires alternative solutions.\r  \n\r  \n**Concluding the discussion, the reintroduction of OP\\_CAT offers both opportunities and challenges, requiring a balanced approach between innovation and network security in Bitcoin's evolution.**\r  \n\r  \n",

    "title": "Major Moon Math Update: Jane Street and The Great Glass Bitcoin ETF",
    "selftext": "# End of the First Week with ETFs &amp; market chaos.\n\nSparkly new ETFs wrapped up their debut week and my chaps have never been more raw.\n\n##Total Net Inflow\nNew ETFs are breaking records, netting a cool +$1.2 billion, moving past the $4 billion mark.\n\n##GBTC's Twisty Tale\nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) dropped a hefty $2.8 billion overall, and on Friday faced a $590 million outflow.\n\n## More Price Stability\nA decade ago I got into regular fights with members of this sub about the increasing price stability of bitcoin. And, despite the initial drop we saw last week, I think that is what we're seeing. Are ETFs partially responsible for this? Yes. But what is the mechanism that's taking money from traders? I'm not so sure about this one, but I'm wondering about how Jane Street and other authorized participants (AP) are involved. \n\n## Jane Street's Influence\nThese ETFs aren't just numbers on a screen. They're being nudged and wiggled by the likes of Jane Street, the puppet masters of the ETF world. Recall that Sam Bankmanfried left Jane Street to create FTX, and recruited from Jane Street (including his \"CEO/GF\" of Alameda Research)\n\nhttps://www.cryptopolitan.com/jane-street-capital-broker-bitcoin-etfs/\n\nJane Street coordinates the purchase and sale of Bitcoin for multiple ETFs (including [GBTC](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/27/grayscale-lines-up-jane-street-and-virtu-as-authorized-participants-if-gbtc-converts-to-etf/), [Wisdomtree](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/jane-street-capital-broker-bitcoin-etfs/), [IBTC](https://twitter.com/alistairmilne/status/1740822439494287843), and [FBTC](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/jane-street-capital-broker-bitcoin-etfs/)) as an authorized participant. In the context of Bitcoin ETFs, an authorized participant (AP) like Jane Street has several key responsibilities:\n\n#### Creation and Redemption of ETF Shares\nJane Street manages the process of creating and redeeming ETF shares. This involves handling the inflow and outflow of funds from the ETF, which is critical for maintaining the liquidity and stability of the ETF.\n\n#### Overseeing Cash Transfers\nAs an AP, Jane Street oversees the transfer of cash to and from the ETF's administrator. This is a vital function for ensuring that the ETF operates smoothly and efficiently.\n\n#### Market Liquidity Maintenance\nA significant part of an AP's role is to contribute to the liquidity of the ETF in the market. They do this by ensuring that the ETF shares are available for trading and by facilitating the process of share creation and redemption. As a result, Jane Street helps ETFs maintain a market price that is close to the net asset value.\n\n#### Interaction with Market Makers\nJane Street may interact with market makers to ensure that the ETF shares are traded at prices that are close to \"their actual value,\" further contributing to setting the market price.\n\n#### Fulfilling Investor Orders\nJane Street may create or redeem ETF shares in large blocks, known as creation units, which are then exchanged with the ETF for baskets of underlying assets or the equivalent value in cash.\n\nJane Street's expertise and experience in trading and market-making, especially in the ETF domain, make them a key player in the operational mechanics of Bitcoin ETFs. Their role is integral to the smooth functioning of these ETFs, ensuring that they reflect the price movements of Bitcoin while offering a regulated, stock-exchange-listed investment vehicle for Bitcoin exposure.\n\n#### Does Jane Street control both sides of the trade?\nIf you look into Jane Street, you know that their focus is on gaming the market to extract maximum value for themselves and they're making a huge amount of money somewhere. If being an AP for ETFs were not providing an ungodly amount of profit, they would not be involved. Also, remember that Jane Street coordinates the purchase and sale of Bitcoin for *multiple* ETFs (including [GBTC](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/27/grayscale-lines-up-jane-street-and-virtu-as-authorized-participants-if-gbtc-converts-to-etf/), [Wisdomtree](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/jane-street-capital-broker-bitcoin-etfs/), [IBTC](https://twitter.com/alistairmilne/status/1740822439494287843), and [FBTC](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/jane-street-capital-broker-bitcoin-etfs/)) as an authorized participant. READ, the buy side and sell side are the same entity, **regardless of which ETF you are buying with**.\n\n\n## The Bigger Picture: U.S. Bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe ETFs' story is a starting gun for a new era in crypto, turning Bitcoin into a blue-chip investment. We're talking about a potential influx of $50 billion or more this year alone. almost 100,000 bitcoin have been taken off the market already. And with Bitcoin's market cap hovering over $913 billion, these ETFs will add extreme bullish pressure to the price in the last two quarters of this year.\n\n## In Summary\n\nThis isn't just about numbers and charts (and assholes). It's about a seismic shift in the crypto universe. The ETFs are reshaping how we think about Bitcoin and its kin. Are we creating a new mental model about a market that's maturing, evolving--unpredictable as ever (but also, maybe, a little more stable)?\n\n## What's next?\n\nOnly time will tell, but one thing's for sure: the crypto market will never be controlled by unprofessional hacks, slinging private keys around on a web server, again.\n\nGood hunting.\n\nhttps://www.moonmath.win/",

The market recovery led to significant price surges in exchange tokens like FTT, MX, and BGB, with FTT experiencing a remarkable 270% surge, linked to SEC Chairman Gary Gensler's positive statement. FTT's momentum continued with FTX announcements, while MX, GT, OKB, and CET showed lower liquidity. Despite HT having a high liquidity ratio, its price dropped by around 50%, indicating a negative trend for HTX traders. Despite being relatively new, BGB, experienced exceptional growth in 2023 with a 291% increase in price surpassing the rise of BTC in the same period,  reaching an all-time high of 0.70499.\n110% spike in trading volume. Number of BGB holders nearly doubled, reaching 354,472 in Q3 alone. Key factors contributing to BGB's growth in 2023 include utility benefits on the Bitget platform (fee discounts, voting rights, and exclusive features), strong ecosystem development through initiatives like the EmpowerX Fund and Web3 Fund, and the overall market recovery in the crypto space during the latter part of the year. 2023 marked a notable year for BGB and other exchange tokens,showcasing resilience and potential.\n\nRead more on the token insight 2023 report here: https://tokeninsight.com/en/research/reports/crypto-exchanges-2023-annual-report\n\nFTT - https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ftx-token\nHT - https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/huobi-token\nBGB - https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitget-token\nMX - https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/mx-token",

The intersection of crypto and real estate has incredible potential, and Parcl seems to be paving the way for innovative solutions.\n\nPost-quantum cryptography is also gaining traction, and projects like [Qanplatform](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/qanplatform/) are at the forefront. Security is paramount in the crypto space, and investing in advanced cryptographic solutions could be a game-changer.\n\nI can't possibly forget GambleFi projects like [Shuffle](https://shuffle.com/) that will bring a new dimension to the crypto space, adding an element of excitement to the ecosystem. \n\nReal-world assets (RWA) are also gaining prominence, and [Realio](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/realio-network/) seems to be making waves in this space.

    "selftext": " As you can see, there is a high chance of having a bull run soon, as BTC has shown a good price move to the upside for several months now. IMO, it's wise to start accumulating gradually.  \n\nBut the real question is what to buy and why I think it’s the best option. I will only be listing the two tokens I’m accumulating now. One is a large cap, and the other is a low cap. Both are my biggest bags, and if you do proper research, you will agree with me that they have a high chance of leading the next bull run.  \n\nThe first is SOLANA; it's funny because I personally FUD SOL a few months ago before it had that huge price move back up. Recently, I have noticed SOL has started gaining a lot of traction, and memecoin is now gradually shifting from ETH to the Solana ecosystem. If this trend continues, then a lot of people will end up buying into SOL, and I predict the price will be around $500 for its next ATH.   \n\nThe second, which is a low-MC gem and is gradually gaining traction, is QANX. It’s a layer 1 hybrid blockchain that is EVM-compatible. One of the features about it that I feel will blow up so much is the fact that it allows developers to code smart contracts in any programming language, which QAN aims to use to onboard over 20 million developers into the blockchain, which I believe even If they are able to achieve 10% of that, then this layer 1 blockchain will be greater than ETH. And my price prediction for QANX is $1 in the next bull run.  \n\nAnyway, please feel free to share with me what altcoins you are buying as well. \n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/)\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/qanplatform/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/qanplatform/)",

We need more plain language explanations of blockchain's world-changing potential.\n\nSuggestions:\n\n- Projects and influencers should lead by example in using language innovators and adopters actually understand. This will accelerate mainstream adoption.\n\n- Writers and educators can contribute by creating educational resources that make blockchain accessible, without dumbing down core concepts. \n\n- We can build communities of practice around simplifying language, sharing effective analogies, and norming on plain communication.\n\nThe blockchain revolution represents a profound social advance.

    "title": "Get to know Qtum: The Basics",
    "selftext": "Qtum is a blockchain platform that merges the advantages of Bitcoin’s UTXO blockchain design and Ethereum’s Smart Contract functionality.\n\nThis combination enables users to create, manage, and engage in blockchain services and products efficiently.\nLet’s explore the unique features and inner workings that make Qtum a notable player in the blockchain sector.\n\nHistory of Qtum\n\nIn September 2017, Qtum’s main network came to life, marking a significant milestone in the blockchain’s history. Over the course of six years, the Qtum core team has tirelessly worked on enhancing the platform, with more than 40 wallet releases to their name.\nSome notable updates include:\n\nThe Decentralized Governance Protocol allows the community to increase the block size up to 8000kb and adjust gas fees on demand.\n\n32-second block targeting and Segregated Witness for higher throughput.\n\nProof-of-Stake consensus model.\n\nTaproot and EVM one updates to the Ethereum Virtual Machine.\n\nQtum core codebase updated to keep up with all BIPs offered with the latest Bitcoin Core release.\n\nQtum’s “Account Abstraction Layer” which allows the UTXO model to host the Ethereum Virtual Machine without needing an Ethereum blockchain clone.\n\nImplementation of popular ERC standards like ERC20, ERC1155, ERC721, etc.\nTheir efforts have focused on increasing blockchain speed while ensuring that the code remains in sync with the latest developments from Bitcoin Core and Ethereum.\n\nSince its inception in 2015, Qtum’s mission has been to create a blockchain that blends the battle-tested stability of Bitcoin Core’s UTXO model with the capabilities of smart contracts on a decentralized Proof-of-Stake mechanism. This unique recipe has proven its relevance over the years.\nOne of Qtum’s notable achievements in the realm of scalability is the introduction of smart contracts that allow the community to adjust gas fees and block sizes.\n\nThis innovation, known as the “Decentralized Governance Protocol,” has made Qtum faster than both Ethereum and Bitcoin without compromising decentralization.\n\nDecentralization remains a core concern for the Qtum team, especially in a landscape where high throughput often takes precedence.\n\nTheir perspective is clear: true mass adoption necessitates a strong foundation of decentralization on the base layer, with layer 2 solutions catering to the need for “millions to billions” of transactions.\n\nUses of QTUM Token\n\nThe purpose of the Qtum token is to pay for gas on the Qtum network and to secure the network through the Proof-of-Stake model. Any other use of the Qtum token is merely speculation on secondary market price action.\n\nThe Qtum network requires a token cost to send coins. If there wasn’t a cost associated with a transaction, anyone could create a looped transaction between two or more wallet addresses and effectively kill the blockchain with spam transactions.\n\nThis is exactly why there’s a gas fee, and the only purpose of the Qtum token is to pay that fee. This doesn’t mean the Qtum network’s only capability is to send and receive tokens. This applies to smart contracts as well.\n\nQtum tokens are also required to solve blocks, also known as staking, which secures the blockchain.\n\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/community/post/331399440",

    "selftext": "A new consensus mechanism called [Proof-of-Entropy-Minima (PoEM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04305) inspired by Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work (POW) Nakamoto consensus mechanism is deployed by Quai Network. PoEM, like PoW, uses hashes generated by competing miners to verify the validity of a proposed block. However, **PoEM differs from PoW in how these hashes are compared and measured**.\n\nUnlike PoW, which treats all blocks that meet a certain difficulty level as equally valid, PoEM measures the intrinsic blockweight to calculate the entropy, or randomness, removed by each proposed block. This ensures that all nodes will always prefer one particular block over any other options. \n\nUnder PoEM, all nodes immediately agree on the next block as soon as they become aware of it, eliminating any disagreements caused by delays in the network. Two nodes running PoEM will always agree on which block is next in the chain.\n\nBy removing contention from consensus, PoEM allows all nodes to remain in continuous agreement. This is different from all other consensus algorithms, which take time to reach consensus or resolve conflicts.\n\nPoEM's \"perpetual consensus\" provides a variety of benefits over existing consensus mechanisms like Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake, including instantaneous fork resolution and faster finality. These properties give PoEM the unique ability to remain in consensus while coordinating an infinite number of execution shards.",

    "title": "Understanding real TPS of popular blockchains",
    "selftext": "In the rapidly changing world of blockchain technology, there's a lot of talk about Transaction Per Second (TPS) and who's leading the pack. But when we dig deeper into those TPS numbers, we find some interesting differences between what's claimed and what's real.  \nBlockchain projects like to show off their \"max TPS\" numbers, but it's important to take a closer look to see what's really going on. We're going to break down the difference between TPS numbers that sound impressive and what they actually mean.  \nTo do this, we've used a straightforward approach. We connected to different blockchains, watched transactions closely, and then did some math based on the last 100 blocks. While blockchains have different speeds, we've kept things simple to focus on understanding TPS.  \nLet's check out the TPS claims of Solana, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Ethereum, and Bitcoin:  \nSolana claims \"65,000 transactions per second,\" but the real TPS is 299.91. That's a huge 217 times difference.  \nArbitrum talks about \"40,000 transactions per second,\" but the actual TPS is only 8.07. That's a whopping 4956 times difference.  \nAvalanche says \"4,500 transactions per second,\" but the real TPS is just 2.01. That's a significant 2500 times difference.  \nEthereum's max TPS is 56, but the current TPS is 11.14. It's only 5 times different.  \nBitcoin's theoretical TPS is 7, but in reality, it's around 4.18. That's just 1.67 times different.  \nTo sum up, there's a big gap between what's claimed and what's actually happening with TPS numbers. While big numbers might sound good, the real measure of success for blockchain is how much it's actually being used.   \n\n\nSource of data is chainspect.app",

I know that a wallet can generate many addresses and each new transaction can use a new address. But I have not been able to find out whether these different addresses can be traced back to the same wallet. From the block explorer I can see that if I send some sats to buy something online only the amount in the UTXO is visible and not other UTXOs and my entire wallet balance. My question is whether someone can find all the other transactions, UTXOs and the entire wallet balance from this small coffee shop transaction? ",

    "selftext": "Crypto currency will only work if, we become completely globalized and convert all existing money into one pre determined coin that no one can buy before hand. If we allow the technology to be securitized it can't work, because if we for example end up using Bitcoin as the Holy currency, a market will be created where people who own the coin before we convert to 100% usage of solely that coin, end up with lots of quantity and can demand higher and higher prices for 1 Bitcoin. A billionaire who buys Bitcoin and is in the last 1% of Bitcoin adopters could end up paying 1 billion dollars for 1 coin. If there truly ever is a conversion from fiat money to a single coin, those fiat currencies that are now the most valuable currencies will have less and less demand and usage as we convert from fiat to a securitized coin currency, making it even more expense for a wealthy late converter to recieve the true past value of his assets. Assets value could end up changing when depending on if you adoprt the currency earlier or later if you are early you could get 100,000 noticing for your house but if not then those who control majority of Bitcoin can abuse you for not having anything else to offer and give you 1 coin if they want.Where as someone who owns some of the coin right now could have a real technical value of 250,00$ at present, in the future there wealth becomes far greater just for having bouht more coins then someone and from buying the lucky coin amongst thousands of coins earlier than everyone else become wealthier than those who didn't. Rich people who own most of the value in the world would also not let this happen and they have huge political influence in every country in the world, and to have one single coin you have to be globalized so countries would make it 100% illegal for that to happen before it started. And those who own the god coin will have zero use and will have a coin who's value is stored in its trading capabilities could become valueless.",

    "title": "Poverty-Reducing Economy via Bitcoin and One-Dollar-Store Model",
    "selftext": "Abstract: this proposal presents a transactional system, based on existing blockchain technology, that permits usage of digital currency ecosystem for reduction of general poverty.\n\nThe Bitcoin and digital currencies based on blockchains are already widely used and understood.  However, it is often assumed that they do not offer any real-world benefits beside financial speculation with an exaggerated risk, or even support of illegal operations…\r\n\nOn the other hand, it is possible to implement enhancements to existing blockchain algorithms of Bitcoin and other digital currencies – the enhancements that may lead to creation of “moneyless economy”, a sub-economy of general economy, with poverty-reducing benefits.\r\n\nThe first part of enhancement requires creation of the “gift card request pool”.  It is similar to a usual memory pool of pending transactions, but instead collects signed requests for “gift cards” provided by real economy agents (unrelated to blockchain miners).  A “gift card” is an abstract object that gives its recipient a right to receive some tangible or intangible product from a real-world producer or store (gift card provider).  For a “gift card request” to be valid, it should include: a wallet identifier of the requester, with this wallet having a non-zero balance; a wallet identifier of the product, which should also have a non-zero balance (zero balance denotes that a gift offer is no longer available); a timestamp.  A gift card request is non-mandatory for fulfilling, and expires in 24 hours.\r\n\nThe moment a gift card request appears in the pool, its associated provider considers the availability of resources to fulfill the request, or if there are too many requests present at a given time, selects (e.g., via a lottery) requests that can be fulfilled immediately.  If the request can be fulfilled, the provider creates a special transaction in miners’ transaction pool.  This gift card transaction (which may only originate from a product wallet) includes gift card receiver’s wallet identifier, transaction fee, and a public identifier string of the issued gift card (which is unique to the provider).\r\n\nThe receiver’s identity (beside wallet) is not included into the request nor transaction as it is assumed that the receiver was already registered with the provider in their local database, to facilitate a timely real-world transfer of a product to this receiver.  The public identifier of a gift card is non-redeemable, and it can be used for product delivery assurance by a third party, which may or may not be mandatory, depending on authority control’s implementation specifics.  This public identifier may also refer to a publicly-accessible information for audit that a provider does actually deliver gifts offered (may include delivery partner’s identifier).\r\n\nSecondly, it is quite obvious that without some authority control both a gift card request and its fulfilling can be easily faked.  In order to avoid or minimize the fraud, the authority transactions should be implemented.  An authority transaction is a singular transfer of a non-zero balance from an “authority wallet” to gift card receiver’s wallet or product wallet, along with a message “grant” or “revoke”, possibly with wallet owner’s confirmed name.  The authority wallets are a set of agreed-upon wallet identifiers shared and accepted by miners (an authority wallet may be related to a specific economy niche a blockchain targets).  Gift card receiver’s and product’s wallets without the most recent “grant” authority message from an agreed authority are not considered valid.\r\n\nEach wallet should pass through a control of at least one agreed authority, which is a real-world process not covered by the blockchain technology nor this proposal, and may require legislation which is not yet in place; a control procedure may involve identity confirmation, some background checks, and an infrequent, but regular processing fee paid from a real-world account, to support authority’s operations.\r\n\nWhere is the money?  This is the third part of the proposed enhancement.  The monetary mass of a digital currency is produced in the process of “mining”: when a miner finds a suitable blockchain hash value, a specific sum of digital currency is awarded to this miner, increasing the monetary mass as a result.  Since this is just a book-keeping operation, the currency can be similarly awarded to the gift card providers.  So, in the proposed enhancement, a miner not only builds a block of transactions for which it tries to find a hash value, but also calculates rewards of gift card providers.\r\n\nHere, the One-Dollar-Store model kicks in: the overall block reward less miner’s own reward is evenly spread over all included gift card transactions.  For example, if block reward is 100 coins, and there were 1000 gift card transactions in the block, 10% (10 coins) plus transaction fees are rewarded to the miner, while the remaining 90 coins are spread over 1000 product wallets: 0.09 coins per wallet.  If there were only 10 gift card transactions in the block, then each product wallet would be rewarded with 9 coins.  There would be no remaining coins awarded if there were no gift card transactions.  This is a self-regulating reward system that balances offers by parties willing to participate and compete for the reward.  The main factors of the competition are: the market reach of a gift card provider, a gift’s quality, and digital currency’s real-world valuation.\r\n\nHowever, most digital currencies favor a “deflationary” model where mining rewards diminish over time.  Since One-Dollar-Store model requires more-or-less stable real goods prices, and needs to account for real-world inflation, an inflationary model is better suited, in order to match the increasing mass of goods to the monetary mass, and to match real-world expenses of gift card providers over time.  For example, the block reward may be fixed at 5% of overall coin mass per year, at any given time, which means that the block reward numerically increases after each mined block.\r\n\nSince it is the miner who prepares the block for inclusion into the blockchain, miner’s software should consider both the gift card request pool and gift card transactions placed by gift card providers: there should be a match of non-zero wallets together with existence of prior “grant” authority transactions.  Matching signed gift card requests should be included into the block, to have a proof of requests’ existence.  As an additional anti-fraud and anti-flood counter-measure, miner’s software may reject transactions between a requester and a provider, for a given product wallet, that again occur sooner than a specific number of blocks: it is common to receive the same product once a day, or even less often.  This goes on top of gift card providers’ possibility to select gift card receivers (e.g., via country and repeatability filters).\r\n\nIn overall, the most problematic parts of this system are authority control and delivery checks (which may be selective and probabilistic).  But considering that digital currencies are generally a “funny money” while poverty is real, an implementation attempt seems a worthwhile endeavor.  With the 500-billion-dollar capitalization of Bitcoin, the proposed system could provide 22 billion dollars of free goods per year, while the “free stuff” at the same time being a great marketing attraction for both the coin and the providers, and an image booster for wealthy investors.  Note that before 2016, Bitcoin’s yearly inflation was way above 5%, yet this had no much negative effect on its then valuations: it is a speculative asset, with the inflation affecting only a part of its expected value.  Real-world currencies are subject to inflation as well, ensuing valuation parity between them and the coin.",

    "selftext": "From [CashTokens.org](https://cashtokens.org/docs/spec/rationale):\n\nOne key insight which precipitated this proposal's bifurcated fungible/non-fungible approach is: token fungibility and token commitments are conceptually incompatible.\n\nFungible tokens are (by definition) indistinguishable from one another. Fungible token systems must allow amounts of tokens to be freely divided and re-merged without tracking the precise flow of individual token units. Conversely, nonfungible tokens (as defined by this proposal) are most useful to contracts because they offer a strategy for issuing tamper-proof messages that can be read and acted upon by other contracts.\n\nAny token standard that attempts to combine these primitives must contend with their conceptual incompatibility – \"fungible\" tokens with commitments are not strictly fungible (e.g. some covenants could reject certain commitments, so wallet software must \"assay\" quantities of such tokens) and must have either implicit or user-defined policies for splitting and merging commitments (increasing protocol complexity and impeding standardization).\n\nBy clearly separating the fungible and non-fungible use cases, this specification is able to reduce each to a more fundamental, VM-compatible primitive. Rather than exhaustively specifying minting, transfer, or destruction \"policies\" at the protocol level – or creating another subsystem in which such policies are user-defined – all such policies can be specified using the existing Bitcoin Cash VM bytecode.",

To sum it up quickly, it’s a L2 for smart contracts that has a separate ledger outside of Bitcoin L1 to allow devs to build on it. The only downside however, is using their token STX for everything, doesn’t really feel like Bitcoin to me.\n\nSo is there any that feel like it provides an actual Bitcoin feel? I haven’t dug enough in the Bitcoin DeFi scene, but one that strikes me as interesting is [Mintlayer](https://www.mintlayer.org/en/). Similar to Stacks, it functions like a L2 Solution building utility on Bitcoin. The biggest difference (which I haven’t seen yet), is the use of Native Bitcoin instead of their project token. The common trend I’ve seen with these DeFi projects is using their token strictly with a wrapped BTC, capitalizing on the name of Bitcoin without actually supporting it as a DeFi project.\n\nI also believe projects can integrate Lightning Network into their platforms to assist in speed and transaction costs, enabling Bitcoin to becoming a viable competitor to Ethereum and other blockchains.\n\nLet me know what you guys think, is L2 on Bitcoin a trend or does it have the possibility of becoming something much larger?",

    "title": "Is my understanding correct that the PoW hash function doesn't have an impact on energy consumption?",
    "selftext": "For some time I wondered if it would be possible to have a PoW hash function that uses less energy. The idea is that the hash function is essentially a delay loop, the purpose of which is to consume energy. So I thought if we could devise a function that uses less energy, e.g. by using operations that necessarily take time (which we could call \"proof of time \\[spent\\]\") but without using as much energy, mining could become less energy intensive.\n\nBut then it occurred to me that it wouldn't make a difference, because if the function was let's say half as cheap to compute, the hash rate would double (because miners could suddenly afford twice as much of it) and the network's energy consumption would return to its previous equilibrium.\n\nIn other words, the energy consumption of the network of miners depends on how much energy the mining profits can buy. So for example, assuming all other parameters stay the same and using BTC for simplicity:\n\n\\- higher BTC price -&gt; mining profits can buy more energy -&gt; more energy used\n\n\\- lower block reward + fees -&gt; less energy used\n\n\\- higher energy price -&gt; less energy used\n\nAnd so on.\n\nImportantly, the BTC price in fiat or the energy price in fiat is irrelevant here. In the formula: BTC/USD \\* USD / kWh, the USD terms cancel each other out, so we're interested in BTC/kWh only. \n\nOf course this is an oversimplification, because I'm ignoring the cost of buying the equipment, housing it, the time it takes to scale up or down the mining operations, market inefficiencies, regulatory uncertainty etc.\n\nWhile the hash function doesn't affect energy consumption, it does affect the level of decentralization. The price we pay for decentralization is redundancy (inefficiency). It could therefore be said that with PoW functions that promote decentralization (e.g. ASIC resistant ones) we get better bang for the buck, because our energy cost is the same, but the product it buys us justifies that price more.",

    "title": "Some views on the Network of Momentum and how its solving fundamental problems of decentralized networks.",
    "selftext": "\nFirst off it's now obvious the key for scaling is layered parallel processing and Zenon's Network of Momentum is inherently built with that in mind thru what's labeled as a dual ledger. Transactions move accross individual account chains using a distributed ledger technology called block lattice, first used by NANO, where each user or account holder has its own blockchain, or ledger, allowing them to make transactions without the need for a third-party validator. \n\nThen similar to the bitcoin mempool, transactions feed the validator set to be confirmed making up the ledger in whats referred to as a Meta-DAG that references the individual account chains of the block lattice. \n\nThis DAG structure made up of heavyweight nodes records transactions to the ledger in a decentralized uncensorable manner and it is designed to achieve scalability, high throughput, and low latency. \n\nAll together its an asynchronous network with the capability for parallel processing and essentially no limit to scalability. This is the paraphrased version but the now classic article with a great breakdown is called\nHow Not To Fracture a Layer One Chain, its found on Hackernoon\n\n\n\nSo based on this consensus, the Network of Momentum was built from the ground up with the goal of true decentralization. While this term has been coerced into the marketing pitch of most crypto projects these days, this project stands out based on these important differences. \n\n- Anonymous Development :The code was released open sourced by pseudo-anonymous devs to remove the fairly obvious risks of central figureheads/control in the tech. Many examples of how not to do this lately but since were only seeing the beginning of the possible disruption stemming from crypto, remaining negligent of the many powerful influences in the world is crucial. \n\n- Fair Launch : Initial token distribution \"gifted\" to participants over 1.5 years by proving a vested interest in the network. This was done by sending BTC to a time locked contract(xStakes) and then running a node on the placeholder chain to earn their stake($ZNN) as well as the initial BTC being refunded over 18 months. This means there was no presale, special conditions for VCs, insider, or premine allocation. It started with a level playing field subject to the free market. \n\n- Progressive Decentralization : Incentives are everything. The problem with most PoS networks is that the validator set is incentivized to trends towards centralization. Validators can just keep spinning up nodes at zero additional cost causing the voting share per validator to remain constant, even if the number increases. The NoM breaks this self-perpetuating oligarchy of single-token Proof-of-Stake networks by decoupling validator rewards and governance. To balance the needs of everyone the NoM employs a dual coin economy powered by two native currencies: $ZNN and $QSR.  The reward for validator/governance nodes(Pillars) is payed out in $ZNN but the collateral required to spin up another validator node requires an ever increasing amount of $QSR to be burned.  Making validators balance between maximizing governance voting power against optimizing financial gain. \n\n- Finally the Embedded full node in every core wallet. Dont trust, verify.\n\n\n\nSo now along with these major components of the project there are some other fundamental differences you can see in the tech that lend itself towards a legitimatelly uncensorable open and fair means of digital exchange.\n\n1. It's a project whose development and governance is now completely community driven.  Already implemented is the on chain development funding mechanism(Accelerator Z) where applications for funding can be made thru the core wallet, Syrius, and funds can be released by voting by participating Pillar nodes. This is possible with the embedded smart contract feature of the network, venture funds are all self governed and verifiable on chain. \n \n2. Coinbase rewards are disinflationary with options for non custodial yeild for all network participants. Have a looks at one of the explorers for info on current rewards. There is native yield for participating in staking and delegating, providing liquidity(PCS) or running one of two types of nodes. \n\n3. The network employs feeless transactions by generating Plasma with the $QSR acting as tokenized network throughput. \n\n4. The project has a strong focus on trust-less interoperability to grow and bridge with other networks. Currently seeing development of a multi chain bridge to ETH and BSC while there is also hash time locked contract based BTC atomic swaps running in testnet launching next month. \n\nWhile still being speculative there is potential for some interesting btc interoperability if you interested in this direction check out some of the articles made by the community. \n\n5. Simple tokenization process with the Zenon Token Standard(ZTS) much like the erc-20, allows protocol level native tokenization, all feeless. Not much function today but you can currently mint tokens in the wallet under this protocol and there is some very exciting development happening with this and a new NFT standard.\n\nThanks for reading if you got this far, its a pretty exciting/stressful time to be in the space but there's also some pretty amazing individuals and communities out there looking builders and users.",

    "title": "Stateful UTXO explained: A new accounting model that combines the security of the UTXO model with the programmability of the account model.",
    "selftext": "Original article: [https://thecryptoanalyst.medium.com/my-top-pick-for-2023-is-alephium-alph-because-it-sets-a-whole-new-security-standard-for-defi-and-8ebe0cb8a64a](https://thecryptoanalyst.medium.com/my-top-pick-for-2023-is-alephium-alph-because-it-sets-a-whole-new-security-standard-for-defi-and-8ebe0cb8a64a)\n\nThe stateful UTXO model will probably constitute a paradigm shift in Defi because it inherently has much higher security for users and devs. The only known iteration of the stateful UTXO model is in Alephium, which also the project that came up with it.  If we consider each *private key* as an owner, then in the Ethereum network each owner has to keep all their eggs in one basket (the account). One of the advantages of keeping everything in one basket is that it improves the programmability of the network. In Bitcoin the eggs of each owner (private key) can be considered as if scattered all over the place. As result the programmability of the UTXO is much lower compared to the account model and the account model with its all eggs in one basket architecture, despite its lower privacy, is key to Ethereum’s smart contract expressiveness. \n\nIn the account model, secondary tokens issued on top of the L1, such as erc20 tokens in Ethereum, are also kept in the same address. So if we start considering also the tokens issued on top of Ethereum, to visualize everything an account contains we can think of a basket with colored eggs, where each color is a different erc20 token. The advantage in terms of programmability here consists in the fact that if we have a smart contract SC that needs to transfer 2 red eggs from A to B once a condition is met, then the smart contract simply moves 2 red eggs from A’s basket into B’s basket.\n\nIt is here that we can also start to visualize the source of the inherent security risks Ethereum’s dapps and defi. Bugs, hacks, exploits etc often inflict losses because everything (for each user) is contained in one basket. So one may authorise a smart contract to move 2 red eggs, but because of a bug the smart contract may take 4 red eggs instead of 2. Or it may take a yellow egg instead of a red one. Or it may be manipulated to move all eggs of all colours and empty the basket completely. This is the inherent risk that Alephium’s stateful UTXO model eliminates. stUTXO is defined as a hybrid of the account and UTXO model, but the easiest way to visualise it is as a way for an owner to create multiple baskets with the same private key. And just like in the UTXO mode, from the outside these new baskets are completely disconnected and impossible to associate with each other.\n\nIn Alephium, while you can keep all eggs in one basket, you can also create a new basket where for example you put the 3 green eggs that are supposed to interact with a specific smart contract. As result of this, since the smart contract doesn’t get to touch or know where the other eggs are, there is no way for you to lose by mistake, through a smart contract bug or hack other eggs you own in the network. The smart contract interacts only with the basket with 3 green eggs, doesn’t see or get close to any pink/blue/yellow eggs you (may) own. This is from my understanding the superior inherent security and better UX that Alephium’s stateful UTXO model brings.",

    "title": "Continuing the Thought experiment of Governance in Blockchain. Dual Chain and Token Governance Model (Rough concept, Rough draft)",
    "selftext": "Warning: this is a very long post, but a pretty interesting idea IMO.\n\n***Dual Chain and Token Governance Model:***\n\n*Goal: Structuring a Decentralized governance structure, that can act as the sovereign governance execution and data availability layer. Built specifically to interact with a Cosmwasm smart contracting platform and perform the necessary Governance actions, as the arm of execution across the IBC.*\n\n**Necessary utilities needed to make such a structure possible:**\n\n* Interchain Accounts\n* Interchain Queries\n* ZK proofs capability over IBC\n* Exclusive or permissioned version of ICS, securing the governance chain, using the smart contracting chain\n\n**Introduction**\n\nProof of stake blockchains to date, have a glaring issue that shouldn't be overlooked. They do not have the level of decentralization needed to sufficiently create a censorship resistant entity. Most proof of stake chains do not have the appropriate number of validators to protect the chain against real, large scale third party threats, and the chains that claim to, tend to have tons of validators being run by a few entities. Blockchains in reality, have two primary ideas around Governance, you have the school of thought, found mostly in proof of work chains like Bitcoin, which has a massive number of nodes validating transactions, with a nearly immutable code unless there is total consensus among the miners themselves. The next school of thought, tends to be more applicable in Proof of Stake. In this model, the network tends to operate in a democratic manner where the delegators stake to the active validators of their choice, and then gain the opportunity to vote on-chain, to decide where the network should go next. This includes things such as where funds from a network treasury should go, whether a network upgrade should be uploaded, and many other democratic decisions to be made.\n\nHowever, there is one fact that tends to be overlooked by many in the crypto space. If a validator set, or a majority of the validator set were to be corrupted in some way, delegators have almost no recourse towards the validators to hold them accountable, outside of selling their tokens and finding a new chain that aligns with their values. This is an inherent risk in the validator/delegator relationship, your values only matter, if the validator gives you the power to matter. However, the harsh reality is, validators are the sole controllers and gatekeepers, of the most important part of a blockchain, the code. This makes it important in my opinion, to figure out how we can get some level of recourse built in at the code level, for delegators to check the power that the validators currently hold.\n\nIn this post, I will introduce a Governance system, built on the Cosmos IBC, that, with certain functionality, could level the field of power in the delegator/validator relationship. I bring up certain topics like the ability for delegators to slash or jail a validator directly if a supermajority believe it is a necesssary move. I also bring up concepts like high deposits for proposals, with deposit incentives and slashing, depending on how the vote goes on-chain. I want to say, I am by no means a \"blockchain expert\", not even close, just someone who has fun thinking about blockchain governance and decentralization. So feel free to critique and comment on the concepts and ideas I am bringing here and let me know where I may be off or where I should look deeper into, to gain better perspective of how governance on the blockchain could work. This post in it's entirety is regarding a specific app-chain I have conceptualized, however bits and pieces of this idea could be interesting on other chains, in their governance systems as well.\n\n**Details of the two chain Governance System**\n\nThis model will consist of a general, cosmwasm smart contracting chain, with a seperate side chain that strictly runs as the sovereign Governance execution layer. Items such as the delegators execution module will require a significant amount of predetermined functionality that will be necessary for such automated Governance to occur. So rather than create significant code complexity and attempt to run both a smart contracting platform and automated Governance modules on one chain, and sacrifice the scalability of one chain. I have opted to implement a second chain, that can handle the code complexity, incentivizes the additional load for validators using its own token and will give a permissionless governance structure allowing for delegators to have certain rights deemed necessary in a decentralized and secure blockchain. These rights will be automatically executable, rather than relying on a developer plan and validator execution. These rights are built into the system, to be enacted by the will of the delegators at any time where consensus of such action would be deemed necessary.\n\nThe two chain model would offload the vast majority of the complexity out to a second chain that’s dedicated to the data availability and execution of governance and the many different forms it can take. This allows for the main smart contracting chain to do what its best at, which is executing contracts and acting as the overall consensus layer necessary to ensure safe, secure transactions with interoperability. This operates on the surface as the domain of validator power. They execute the transactions in a permissionless way, acting as the will of developers, smart contracts and the customers these contracts are designed to be utilized by. The second chain has a very specific skill set as a Governance module, the predetermined slashing functions and delegator voting transactions will happen on this chain, away from the general influence of the smart contracting chain and allowing Governance transaction and contracting transactions to be separate, but remain linked together with interwoven functionality between the chains.\n\nThis Governance chain will need the ability to perform these slashing functions at the will of the delegators, and therefore the IBC will need to have such functionality, that one chain can execute its will on the other chain in a permissionless manner. I do believe that functionality is possible with new functions like Interchain Accounts and Interchain Queries, however a variation of Zero Knowledge proofs across IBC may be necessary as well, to be able to provide a proof to the contracting chain, acting as the command to slash as specific validator when the proof is received. Without ZK proofs, this information could provide issues of overwhelmingly bloated IBC transactions and may not allow the direct assurance needed to make the transaction fully automatic. In a situation without ZK proofs, this may require developer and validator action and trust, in order to execute the necessary actions. With that said, the two main functions that will be necessary are the zero knowledge proof, vindicating that action is necessary, and the predetermined functionality of automated slashing on the smart contracting chain, to ensure proper execution.\n\nZK proofs and the automated governance module, that would act as the execution “contract” and provides proof of mutual assent between the governance and smart contracting chain. Resulting in a trustless and permissionless piece of core functionality in the relationship between these two chains. An example of permitted action from a ZK proof from the Governance chain, would be it sending an IBC proof that, in the governance module would read like this;\n\n“A slashing action was voted on and approved, by a supermajority of delegators, for the slashing of (X) validator for (Y) reason stated in our mutual assent, here is the (ZK) proof. Therefore per the terms of our agreement, you need to slash (X) validator for breaching their social contract with delegates”\n\nThis should act as seamless, automatic action with no need to trust developers to create such code and no need to trust validators to upgrade or execute such code. Rather the code is a part of the basic function of both of these chains, with terms of mutual assent stored in both chains, in a hard coded module, allowing it to be performed as any action on the chain would be and with equal immutability.\n\n**Securing the system, shared security between the two chains**\n\nThe governance chain will operate under a similar structure to a permissioned version of ICS. This will allow them to have the same level of security, with a smaller amount of governance rewards being paid to delegators, since the majority of tokens should be earned through governance participation.\n\nI believe this model will allow for a high degree of value capture between the chains and will be the best option to keep the validator set the same for both chains by utilizing ICS for a model with two chains needing to be attached at the hip, so to speak.\n\nWhether the chain will have the capability to onboard other chains similar to how the Cosmos Hub does, would be left to the market to decide and would leave additional opportunity for growing its interchain services.\n\n**How a proposal may work on the two chain Governance structure** (rough rundown)\n\n* A proposer starts by connecting their wallet to the central governance chain and governance hubs UI. Ideally this wallet would be whatever the most popular wallets are in the Cosmos ecosystem (Keplr, Cosmostation).\n* The proposer initiates the UI to make a proposal. They will provide a full detailed run down of their proposal, and this proposal will initiate into the deposit stage.\n* The deposit in general, will be a rolling .5% of the circulating supply, that adjusts per day, at an epoch of its own. This deposit amount will not change for the 21 day deposit period. After 21 days, if the proposal has not had the required amount deposited, then the deposit will be disbursed back to the original wallets that sent the funds.\n\n(Note: Should a deposit be editable while in the proposal phase? Maybe a certain time like 19 out of the 21 day deposit period, so negotiation and debate can take place with meaningful results can be added to the proposal. What stops this from frequently changing so people can’t keep up, fee per edit?)\n\n* A successful deposit will be automatically, in its final form, be uploaded on chain for official voting.\n\nDeposit risk and incentive- The goal of this model is to incentivize and encourage good governance with on-chain, economic assurances. One assurance would be, depositors will be incentivized for on-chain proposals that pass through the voting process. However, economic assurances must come with balance. The balancing power is, if a proposal ends its voting period with a “No With Veto”, then a deposit slash (example, 10% of total deposit slashed) will occur, giving a penalty for wasted on-chain governance,\n\nas voted on by the voters. This risk/reward structure should motivate good proposals, with wording that comes easy enough for people to understand as well as ideas that are sound. While spam proposals will likely never make it on-chain, as most spam stops at the hub deposit period. The overarching idea being that depositors are more likely to want to preserve capital and only risk there tokens on a proposal they see as valuable, to earn incentives, rather than risking a slashed proposal.\n\n* It is from the point of the proposal being uploaded that a 10 day voting time frame will begin, with a 40% quorum minimum at the time of the end of the period. After this period and depending on results, the deposits plus or minus the incentive/penalty will be automatically returned. Deposits that are slashed can be sent to a treasury, sent to delegators of the staking token, burnt or wherever the community may decide in this matter.\n\n**How software upgrades could be handled on-chain:**\n\nSoftware upgrades inherently come with many responsibilities to try to work out every potential issue before submitting a proposal for the validators to upload. A testnet requirement with hub functionality that allows for multi-validator slashing by delegators, if they do not utilize the full testnet and do proper due diligence. This system would need to have some level of oracle functionality to relay information of the start of a testnet, and the time the testnet has been in process. The due process of the Testnet would be that the full testing period should be fulfilled before the Testnet ends and the upgrade is uploaded. This requirement can be sufficiently nullified if a signaling proposal is made by the community and passes, to allow early exit of the Testnet, penalty free.\n\n**Slashing and Jailing process**\n\nThe slashing punishment, is a power left ultimately to the judgment of the delegators to enact, as this power would be strictly left to a delegator only model with no voting ability by any validators. A way to accomplish this could be through the knowledge of the validators address used for staking reward payouts and general voting address, and using that knowledge to having those addresses added as invalid addresses for the delegator specific voting module. Delegators will have this exclusive slashing ability, however, this should have an element of due process of on-chain approvals, to minimize the risk of delegator abuse.\n\n* This process needs to start with a general signaling proposal, however this signaling proposal should take place in a delegators specific voting module, where validator wallets will be excluded from voting, to allow for a proper democratic voting demonstration.\n* This general signaling proposal will require a 51% quorum with a 67% approval before this would be considered passed and moving into the execution phase.\n* The execution phase will add in what would be new functionality of automated slashing, where the delegators can pick out which validators are to be slashed, and this slashing will be done at the protocol level, via an execution proposal, that will include a specific set of “reasoning” behind why delegators are proposing to implement a slash, with an additional secondary vote to ensure the slashing execution is the way the network wants to proceed. The proposal period will be the same as the signaling proposal at 51% quorum and 67% approval of this slashing. The Execution module will require a significant amount of predetermined functionality that will be necessary for such automated Governance to occur.\n\n*Jailing a validator*\n\n* An additional delegator power that could be added to a Governance system could be a delegation jailing a validator from the network of the jailing is deemed necessary by delegators and the function deemed necessary to be jailed, is not automated on-chain. This could be a process very similar to the slashing function and could prorate in a similar model.\n\n**General actions that could constitute a reason for delegators right to slash or jail a validator:**\n\n* A validator or multiple vote on a proposal in a way that is out of character for the general social consensus of the network, thereby giving the network recourse against actors who seek to change the network outside the scope of what is generally seen as reasonable by the network. This recourse could cause a validator or multiple to seek a hardfork, which could split the network, but the network should seek a hardfork if enough validators and many delegates agree. Ultimately the right to fork should persist, and these governance measures are to be enacted when it is deemed most necessary to keep the general social consensus heading on the track that is generally approved.\n* If a validator or multiple validators were to become corrupted in some way by a malicious third party. It may be possible, in this scenario, for a significant slash or jailing could occur, that could effectively remove or limit the corrupted validators power over the network. Restaking to a safe, trusted and not corrupted validator would also be a possibility, however in some cases where a wealthy validator is holding most of its delegation by itself, this slashing could do material harm to the overall power the validator had.\n\nCertain parameters would need to be set to make these Governance proposals executable, which could take some amount of foresight. However, the checks and balances of this system could be extremely interesting.\n\n**A deeper look at risks and rewards in depositing for a proposal:**\n\nThe role of incentives is a straightforward idea, however the model I prefer is somewhat unique, at least compared to what I’ve seen. In most incentive structures the incentive is used to pay someone for voting or pay someone to vet proposals. However I don’t believe paying someone to vote, actually generates a good governance system, rather one where small amounts are paid to those who vote and a larger amount to the privileged ones with the time to review and vet proposals, or become a member of some council. I think there is a better and more inclusive way to incentivize good governance.\n\nEssentially, the process comes with the premise that if we want to ensure good, high quality governance, the proposal needs to be backed by a deposit that depositors are risking, in hopes that the proposal is quality enough for the community to approve, thereby giving the depositors a reward paid out in the Governance token. This reward, however, would only be paid out after the proposal has passed, then the depositers into then successful proposal will receive their incentives for promoting good governance on the blockchain.\n\nThe flip side of the coin is that if a proposal ends with a “No With Veto”, then it was likely a wasted proposal and should be slashed, as a punishment for wasting time and blockspace. This skin in the game approach, would make the proposers think twice about small little proposals that don’t really propose a meaningful addition to the network. This slashing risk however, is only limited to a “No With Veto”. We do not want to take this too far with making a “No” voted proposal be slashed. Many “No” voted proposals will have legitimate changes offered, that the network simply didn’t want to utilize at the time or they simply felt that the proposal did not represent the will of the delegators. So these “No” votes will not be slashed, rather the full deposit will be returned after the voting period has ended.\n\n**A recent example of bad governance in Cosmos**\n\nMany community members didn’t like Prop 89, one of the Cosmos Hubs most recent governance proposals. However, with all of the controversy and ruckus it brought amongst the community, the proposal passed thanks to a few powerful validators.\n\nThis proposal could have had a very different outcome, had it been in the two chain governance system. In my opinion, the proposal likely would have never met the deposit amount of .5% of the current circulating supply without the entity proposing it making a large deposit or some larger entities coming in and helping to make the deposit of roughly 1,460,000 ATOMs. Would the ATOMs they had requested even been worth the risk of losing a large sum of ATOMs if the proposal was a “No With Veto” and the deposit was slashed?\n\nThese different risk/reward additions to governance could encourage good governance in a very meaningful way. You could see that the valuable proposals and upgrades are the ones that make it through the pipeline, and the governance that doesn’t make an impact will never make it through the deposit period without a significant risk to the deposited funds.\n\n**Shorter validator voting period**\n\nIn general, a separate issue could be addressed. The fact that validators were able to vote last minute to make prop 89 pass, is a flaw that gives the largest and most powerful, the ability to totally sway a proposal. So the two chain model would also include a 2 day difference between the validator voting period and the delegator voting period. Within this two days, the delegators would have the ability to win over public opinion who may not have voted or may have abstained, thereby allowing the delegators to have a bit of time for coordination in the event that a proposal is on the brink of passing or failing, and the community at large wants to sway it in their preferred direction.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhat benefit could this experiment of a two chain governance structure provide to the community and blockchain as a whole. Largely, this model would be a proof of concept. That this model could work to help decentralize a network and level the playing field for its delegators, rather than just its validators, and potentially make it more secure against third party risk.\n\nThe idea that a blockchain is as decentralized as its stake among validators, is a flawed narrative. Validators have a sole oligarchy over the entrance if effective code, and one coordinated effort by a majority of the validators, could seriously affect the network in a negative way. The slashing and jailing at the code level, with the rights to do so at the delegators full discretion, could be an interesting way to solve the issue of third party risk, and gives the delegators recourse to fight back against a corrupted or malicious validator set.\n\nPlease feel free to comment and critique (Also, sorry for any grammar or spelling mistakes). This is an important topic going forward in blockchain, as we need to figure out how to become more decentralized and censorship resistant as time goes on. I am loving this thought experiment.\n\nThanks for reading.",

The energy cost of mining is thus adjusted and internalised to the network proportionally according to hashrate.\n\nI came across a project that in my opinion has an interesting take on consensus algorithms and what might be the optimal tradeoffs to make for a Layer 1 cryptocurrency in terms of energy usage and scaling. I’m curious about what you guys think of the technical aspects of “Proof of Less Work”.\n\nPoLW internalises the external energy cost of mining by having miners ***burn coins*** before receiving mining rewards and consume less energy proportionally according to the network’s hashrate. In this way, Alephium argues that security is not compromised, while energy cost is reduced to 1/8 of BTC’s energy usage in similar network conditions.\n\nThe question is, could this actually work? I’m actually looking for some critical views of this kind of model, but lack the expertise to really poke holes in it.  Right now PoS seems superior to PoW because of the reduced energy usage, but if PoW was more energy efficient, could it tip the scales back to its side?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit:  [PoLW Whitepaper](https://github.com/alephium/white-paper/blob/master/polw.pdf) and a [PoLW focused discussion with the founder](https://medium.com/@alephium/tech-talk-1-the-ultimate-guide-to-proof-of-less-work-the-universe-and-everything-ba70644ab301) for people who are more curious.",

    "selftext": "Why do some networks still use PoW? It’s clear now that PoS is a better and faster consensus mechanism. In terms of energy consumption PoW is immense. The EU is already planning to design a measuring mechanism for cryptocurrencies that will control energy consumption and I think it’s a good move.  However, when Ethereum moved to PoS it lost its decentralization, but we can see other successful networks that run on PoS and keep being decentralized.\n\nMoreover, in terms of usage, to ensure the network is secure, fast and cheap we also need to look at the project's utility, supply and demand. These factors are the key for a well functioning network. PoW has nothing to do with either of them. Here I’ll give you an example with the most popular PoW network - Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin is high not only because it has value, but also because the result of supply, demand and utility leads to the price it has (which include energy consumption). So in spite of PoW’s few advantages such as decentralization and security, it is economically and ecologically expensive and I think we need to move away from it. We can already see the PoS solutions that guarantee secure, decentralized, fast and cheap networks.\n\nI like some PoS approaches new gen networks use, e.g. Cardano, Everscale, Algorand, Tezos…Why do some chains still keep working on PoW though, mostly, Bitcoin? As PoS proves to be a better alternative and there are more new solutions coming, why does PoW still exist?",

    "selftext": " I became a little obsessed with the security issues recently xD. That made me study a bit, well I don’t complain but it turned out to be complicated to understand. \n\nNow PoS is the most common protocol among blockchains but some still use PoW, where  Bitcoin is the most popular. On one hand, I understand that PoS is better in terms of energy, resources and consequently gas economy, also more users can become validators with PoS as they do not have to buy complicated computing blocks. But on the other hand I still have some doubts inside my brain about this: now with PoS everything is measured in the stake you hold and that means blockchains are becoming less decentralized as they used to be with Bitcoin? This is also backed up by the fact Bitcoin remains the most decentralized compared to others. I mean the more stake you have - more power you have on voting, if it does not work like that please explain.\n\nNevertheless, I’m still interested in what PoS protocol consensus are the safest? As far as I know different blockchains have their own consensus. Cosmos has BFT Tendermint consensus which is quite accountable. PolkaDot uses NPoS - they have roles of validators and nominators that maximizes chain security as nominators have to approve validators candidates first. Everscale uses SMFT where a random set of verifiers are selected from validators and thus it improves security. Still how to figure out which one of these mechanisms ensure 100% security? And in case of different roles there (like validators, nominators, verifiers etc.) who chose the groups of such people?",

    "title": "What Exactly is the VASIL Hard Fork: In Simple Terms (Part 2 of 2)",
    "selftext": " Original Article (with images): [https://www.publish0x.com/ada-crunch/what-exactly-is-the-vasil-hard-fork-in-simple-terms-part-2-o-xpzxrdd](https://www.publish0x.com/ada-crunch/what-exactly-is-the-vasil-hard-fork-in-simple-terms-part-2-o-xpzxrdd)\n\nLast time we covered some key details of Cardano’s VASIL Hard Fork. This time we have some more. Hopefully, it doesn’t get too complicated. If it does ask for clarification in the comment section.\n\n**CIP-31**\n\nCardano Improvement Proposal 31 (CIP-31) allows for a new type of input to transactions: reference inputs. These reference scripts will hold information on the output of a transaction without spending that transaction.\n\nCurrently, if a Cardano dApp developer wants to access the outputs of a transaction (to which address does the ADA go and how much is sent and left over), the UTXO must be spent and then recreated. This wastes time (since dApps will have to wait for the next block to recreate the UTXO) and incurs more transaction fees. CIP-31 will greatly improve the efficiency of dApps by allowing them to access more information without paying an extra fee. Ultimately, VASIL will allow transactions with reference inputs to be put on the blockchain for one transaction fee and then that information will be available to all for no extra cost.\n\n**CIP-33**\n\nCIP-33 allows outputs of a transaction to have another editable field: reference scripts. Previously, if a smart contract wanted to use a script in a transaction, it would need to contain the entire script. This makes the size of transaction data larger and incurs greater gas fees for users and dApp developers. With CIP-33, a transactions reference script field will contain a short address that points to the location of the script on the blockchain. So, multiple transactions can use the same script by just referencing it instead having to rewrite the script in every transaction, so any common scripts can become reusable across the blockchain.\n\n**CIP-40**\n\nThis improvement proposal is pretty simple. CIP-40 is meant to protect dApp developers from losing extra funds if they make a mistake while building applications. Transactions using smart contracts require some collateral of ADA to cover the costs of contracts failing, but developers can put more than the minimum amount. CIP-40 gives the extra ADA back if a contract fails and the developer had put more than the minimum amount of collateral. This prevents developers from experiencing unnecessary losses of ADA.\n\nAs you can probably tell, the VASIL hard fork brings many intuitive changes to the Cardano blockchain — improving its speed and usability without compromising on security. Even though the Cardano blockchain is already much more efficient compared to others (like Ethereum and Bitcoin), the future entails many more Cardano users, which can overload the blockchain. To counter this, Cardano needs more hard forks like VASIL (which are planned to occur in the [Basho](https://adacrunch.medium.com/5-years-of-never-ending-innovation-happy-birthday-cardano-d93ea7f91de3#:~:text=Japan%E2%80%99s%20Edo%20Period-,Basho%20%7C%20Scaling%3A,-From%20Cardano%E2%80%99s%20roadmap) era).",

    "selftext": "Read about this [Medium article](https://medium.portto.com/aptos-review-series-2-account-system-e8e8af712115) talking about the various different forms of Account Systems in Crypto. Such as the UTXO Model, Account-based Model, Private Keys, etc. Thought it'd be great for a thread discussing the current systems and what would be used long term(Simplifying points from the article for the thread).\n\nBitcoins ledger system is based on asymmetric cryptography. Generate a private key and corresponding public key (address) and that itself is your \"identity\". A very straightforward and barebones model but it does the job on a broad level.\n\nAccount Based Models are more intuitive and flexible, like the \"upgrade\" of the UTXO model. We're talking about keeping data such as NFTs, dApps, Friends' address, etc., think MetaMask, Phantom wallet, and more. As for the authentication mechanism, it's still taken from private keys.\n\nWhat happens if you have a social identity attached to that address but you lose it? Well in theory your digital identity is \"gone\". Is there a solution to this?\n\nThat's where rotatable keys can potentially be used. In addition to having a digital key, you could also incorporate 2FA, Multi-party auth from DAOs, and even recovery mechanisms in the worst case. For example, Dapper Wallet on Ethereum and Aptos provide something to support the digital identity as well as having verification beyond just the identity.\n\nDo you guys think Crypto will inevitably stick to it's roots of the original ledger system or will rotating keys/multi-sig auth become more prominent as time progresses. Personally I believe that the OG ledger system does the job, but for those that may not be as hardcore in Crypto, it may be beneficial to provide alternatives to them, especially if they lose access.",

    "title": "Safe Lightning Transactions Without The Need for Watch Towers or Continuous Network Connectivity",
    "selftext": "I believe I have come up with a way to have safe, privacy maintaining, LN transactions without the need to remain online.\n\nI have [published the article on Medium](https://medium.com/@zacheryglass_32401/safe-lightning-transactions-without-the-need-for-watch-towers-or-continuous-network-connectivity-605432efba5e). Please check it out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;One  of the biggest issues with Bitcoin’s Lightning Network is that constant  self-monitoring is required to keep your funds secure and to prevent  theft by your state channel counterparty.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Today  I describe a mechanism by which you may be able to achieve safe second  layer transaction without the need for continuous network connectivity.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\---  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Consider the following:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Alice  and Bob open a state channel with an on-chain multisig transaction. The  channel is then assigned a unique Channel ID. Alice and Bob want to  perform their first transaction via the state channel (transaction #0).  They first agree on the private encryption key. We’ll call this PK-0.  They both sign transaction #0, agreeing on the new state of the channel.  When doing this, they embed PK-0 into the data field of the  transaction. They each hold this transaction and do nothing with it  (unless they otherwise want to close the channel, at which time they  would publish the transaction onto layer 1).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;When  they want to perform their second transaction on the channel  (transaction #1), they will first agree on a new private key, this is  PK-1. They both sign transaction #1, with PK-1 embedded in this  transaction. This is the new state of the channel.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Again,  they will each hold onto this transaction unless they wish to close the  channel. However, this time they will also encrypt this transaction  data with public key that corresponds to PK-0 (the private key embedded  in the ***previous*** transaction),  and send the encrypted transaction to everyone else on the Lightning  Network, along with their Channel ID associated with this transaction.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Craig, another user on the Lightning Network (and many others) receive this encrypted transaction and hold onto it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Alice  and Bob can continue to transact over their channel, each time they  will agree on a new PK and encrypt their channel state and send it to  Craig (and others). Each time Craig receives a new encrypted channel  state for this Channel ID, he holds onto it and keeps track of which  channel ID it is associated with. Since Craig likely doesn’t have enough  storage space to hold every transaction that occurs on the LN, the  Channel ID allows Craig to “monitor” (secure) a subsection of the  channels on the network.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If  either Alice or Bob attempts to cheat by publishing an old state to the  blockchain (transaction #0), they would also be making PK-0 public  (because PK-0 was embedded in the transaction #0). At this time, Craig  would see transaction #0 published on the network, and would realize  that he has a newer state for this channel. Since transaction #0  contained PK-0 within it, Craig would be able to use PK-0 to decrypt the  encrypted copy of PK-1 that he was holding. He could then publish  transaction #1 to the blockchain, invalidating the cheater’s transaction  #0. As an incentive for doing this, Craig would be rewarded with a  portion of the cheater’s funds from the channel (additional complexity  here ignored for the purpose of this description).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In  the case that there is a transaction #2 that occurred on this channel  between Alice and Bob, Craig would be holding an encrypted copy of  transaction #1 and #2. He has a copy of transaction #1 encrypted with  PK-0 and transaction #2 encrypted with PK-1.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If  Bob attempts to cheat by broadcasting transaction #0 to the Bitcoin  network, he will be publishing PK-0, which Craig will use to decrypt his  copy of transaction #1. Upon decrypting transaction #1, Craig will  retrieve PK-1 that is embedded within transaction #1. He can then use  PK-1 to decrypt his copy of transaction #2 (he can repeat this process  as many times as needed until he decrypts the latest state of the  channel). At this point, Craig will have the latest state of the  channel. Which he can then publish to the chain. Since this state is  newer, the cheater’s transaction will be invalidated, and Craig will be  rewarded with a portion of the cheater’s funds that were in the channel.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(Alternative  implementations may allow Craig to only hold the latest state of the  channel, rather than the entire history of every transaction for the  channel, greatly reducing Craig’s storage costs)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If  Craig attempts to publish a state that is not the newest state of the  channel, any other user who chose to monitor the state of this channel  (by storing the historic encrypted states) like Craig did, would be able  to publish the newest state of the channel, invalidating Craig’s  transaction, and they would get the reward instead of Craig. Craig will  have done himself no good.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This  scheme means that Alice can safely use the Lightning Network without  the need to be always online, and without the need for a watch tower,  all while keeping her transaction private. This is because Craig and  many others will always be incentives to act as watchtowers for the  entire lightning network, but only need to hold encrypted copies of the  channel’s state.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\---  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So  how can I be sure that my channel will be monitored (remain secure)  while I am offline? If too many transaction occur on the Lightning  Network, Craig might not have enough storage space to monitor the state  of every Lightning channel. Craig will instead only monitor a subsection  of the channels that exist. Other monitors on the network with limited  resources can monitor a unique subsection of the network. In this way,  we can have a sharding-like security model on the network where no  single person is required to maintain the state of every channel.  Instead, each monitor will secure a small part of the LN state  proportional to their resources. Of course, the more resources you  provide for monitoring, the more channels you can watch, and the higher  the potential rewards will be for preventing cheat transactions.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Here’s how it could work:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Craig  will continuously broadcast to the rest of the network participants the  list of state channels (Channel IDs) he is monitoring. When Dan, a new  user with limited resources wants to become a monitor for potential  rewards like Craig, it’s in his best interest to monitor channels that  Craig is not already monitoring. It’s also in Craig’s best interest to  tell Dan which channels he’s monitoring so Dan will choose different  ones. *It’s in everybody’s best interests to be public  about which channels they are monitoring, and to monitor which ever  channels has the least amount of monitors already.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Suppose  Craig and Dan are the only 2 monitors on the network and that they each  have only enough resources to monitor half of the channels. Craig will  want to tell Dan which half of the channels he is monitoring, and Dan  will want to monitor which-ever channel have the fewest monitors  already. This is because the fewer monitors a channel has, the more  likely it is that you will be the one to get the reward for securing the  channel if a channel participant attempts to cheat.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If  you are the only monitor of a channel, you have a 100% chance of  receiving the reward for preventing a cheater. If you are monitoring a  channel with 2 total monitors, then you have a 50% chance. If there are 3  total monitors, then you have a 33.3% chance or receiving the reward in  the event of a cheat attempt, and so on.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Since  everyone will be broadcasting which channels they are monitoring,  Alice, a user of the Lightning Network, should be able to see how many  monitors are securing her channel. If she sees that there is a high  number of monitors watching her channel, she can safely go offline with  the knowledge that at least one of the monitors will remain online while  she is gone. She can periodically get online to check that she still  has a high number of monitor securing her channel, but she would not  need to remain online to secure it herself.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Her  channel balance will only be unsecured if there are zero monitors  watching her channel state. If Alice ever notices that there are a small  number of monitors securing her channel and fears that they may all go  offline at once while she is gone, she can choose to remain online  herself to watch / secure the channel herself. However, this is unlikely  to happen since new monitors who join the network will always choose to  secure the channels with the fewest monitors already. This should  result in every channel having about the same amount of monitors.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;While  monitoring participants can potentially lie about which channels they  are monitoring, it is against their own interest to do so. And Alice  only needs to trust that 1 of the active monitors securing her channel  will remain online and honest.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\---  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\*This  description purposely contains some over-simplification for the sake of  conveying the basic idea without too much added complexity. Additional  complexity would be needed in a real implementation to work around  technical limitations.",

    "title": "Why is bitcoin mining difficult if hashing is easy?",
    "selftext": "TL:DR - Why is bitcoin mining actually difficult when hashing is inherently an easy computational task?When researching what bitcoin miners are hashing I always end up with the same result:\n\nMiners take the blocks header, tx data, nonce and guess a hash with a specific amount of zeroes in front of a hash according to a predetermined difficulty. The result is proof that work has been spent to get the hash to prove there was no cheating.\n\nBut from experience, I know that hashing data is inherently a fairly easy computing process. You can do it on literally any device (even with pen and paper), you just open any command line, take any piece of *data* and apply a SHA-256 algorithm and you get a hash. Many do this daily to check open source software for tampering when comparing a publicly provided hash to your local hash. And the hash is supposed to be always the same for the same piece of *data* which verifies for tampering.\n\nI've been trying to figure something out for a while but can't seem to get my finger on it. Why is hash guessing actually difficult if miners are simply taking the *data* from the block and deriving the hash from it?\n\nThe few reasons I can come up with are if the miners are guessing a hash for a block that is still in the process of being filled, hence the hash is still unclear due to changing data, so **are the miners hashing into the future until the block fills up and one of the hashes turns out to be correct?**\n\nOr **is the nonce not known to the miner and along with the hash the miners have to also guess the correct nonce as well to achieve the necessary amount of zeroes?** How can the nonce be unknown initially?\n\nWhat is the correct answer here?",

    "title": "Are there any money-ready cryptocurrencies or platforms? What would it take to make an economic-grade cryptocurrency?",
    "selftext": "Perhaps unusually - and very ironically - for many in this, I've long been interested in cryptocurrency (though hardly ever used it, precisely because of this) for exactly what it says on the tin: its use as *money*, i.e. as a medium of value exchange as well as store of economic value, that is decoupled from centralized governments and billionaire-controlled banks, not to mention that it's got that \"cool tech\" factor. And I am actually kind of annoyed at (and have never used it as) how much it gets used to speculate to make money in fiat currency that it is claimed to replace. But that's not a discussion for the Tech forum, just giving you an intro.\n\nNaturally, I've also read a lot of critical material as well as promotional for the technology, and have some familiarity with how it works in and of itself. And it seems there are at least 4 main issues that get in the way of using it as proper money as I would define it - i.e. doing end-to-end transaction in pure crypto, for a non-monetary good priced in crypto, to be exchanged for said crypto:\n\n1. **Energy use**: Bitcoin, especially, consumes an incredibly high proportion of energy compared to how many transactions are done on it. Caught between the dual pinches of climate disruption and the eventuality of fossil fuel scarcity, this is not something sustainable for the long term,\n2. **Lack of decentralization**: Many crypto networks are actually not even close to perfectly decentralized in practice, but end up in the hands of often the biggest holder. This frustrates the political ideals that the coin embodies and at least the kind I'd be thinking of it as a part of when imagining using it,\n3. **Transaction speed**: Bitcoin has a 30 minute transaction speed. This is far too slow for anything approaching the size of even a small national economy in today's terms, which requires sub-second transaction speeds and millions of transactions per day,\n4. **Data usage**: At least conventional Blockchains require each network node to store *an entire copy* of the entire ledger from \"since time immemorial\". This, again, is a big problem in light of (3), and in a way, in (1) due to the consumption of hard drives and other storage devices and attendant material (as opposed to energetic) resources. Millions of transactions per day would generate potentially gigabytes of data *on every computer node every day*. If those computers are thus not continually growing in terms of storage, conventional Blockchain will - and quite quickly - hit big walls.\n\nNow I know that problem (1) can be \"solved\" in a very nominal sense by switching Proof-of-Work (PoW) for Proof-of-Stake (PoS) systems, but that switch seems to come at a politically hard-to-palate cost, hence the \"nominal\" (I consider myself at least sympathetic to \\[left\\] anarchism, even if not \"all the way there\" \\[definitely strongly anti-carceral &amp; anti-cop\\], and with room for markets &amp; money), because they in a sense further encourage (2) - i.e. reproducing the \"ownership by billionaires\" that the current capitalist system has via the huge banking cartels. Though one could argue that since the risks in (1) are existential, then this is an \"acceptable\" trade, but it's only a very, very, very, very barely acceptable one. Also, regarding (3), one could argue this is amenable to social (instead of technological) solutions: not buying a lot of stuff / abhorring the \"consumerist lifestyle\" (super sympathetic with /r/Anticonsumption for eco reasons and never have been a big \"shopper\" due to having lived my whole life in the low income brackets), but that doesn't mean it might not still matter at some point particularly given the sheer complexity of a diverse and large economy capable of producing a high standard of living in terms of well-met needs of food, water, shelter, medical care, and education esp. given the attendant technological base required which means a lot of supporting industries. (4), though, is perhaps the most interesting, because I've never seen much really talking about it in depth. Heck, some people have tried to argue to replace the PoW and PoS with a \"proof of hard disks\" or something like that which deliberately chews up vast quantities of hard drives. I'd argue this is at least no less bad if not even worse, because that will utterly ravish our supplies of needed technological metals especially.\n\nThe overall sense I get, basically, is that cryptocurrencies of any form do not seem really ready to even be used to try to start building any real economy on. Is this a fair surmisement? What would it take to overcome all 4 obstacles mentioned above, if it is? I.e. what are the chief things missing with existing crypto algorithms, softwares, and networks that prevent resolution of the above problems in and to a satisfactory way and degree? Of course, I'm also aware there is no perfect system of anything, but there is also such a thing as being closer to and further from an ideal. If it is *not* a fair surmisement, then which crypto projects go at least the farthest toward addressing these 4 problems? What is the most promising work being done toward them?",

    "selftext": "The report paints the clearest picture yet of what crypto operations are costing both power grids and the environment in the US. It also lays out some potential actions the Biden administration could take to address these challenges.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers in particular have been worried about whether the crypto industry that has exploded in the US over the past year might derail climate goals. And as extreme weather pushes power grids to their limits across the US, there’s growing concern that the most electricity-hungry cryptocurrencies could put even more strain on already vulnerable energy systems.\n\nCrypto asset operations use between 0.9 and 1.7 percent of the US’s total electricity use, according to the new report. And burning through that much electricity generates greenhouse gas emissions that are heating up the planet. Crypto asset activity in the US is responsible for about as much greenhouse gas pollution as all the diesel fuel used on the nation’s railroads, the report says. That’s 25 to 50 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, or 0.4 to 0.8 percent of total US greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe data in the report includes cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and other tokens using blockchain technologies. But there’s one particular technology that’s driving most of these challenges: it’s a kind of security system called proof of work that currently underpins the largest cryptocurrency networks: Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nProof of work gobbles up most of the energy that the crypto industry uses. With proof of work, crypto “miners” race to solve puzzles for the chance to validate blocks of transactions. Those blocks get added to the blockchain, and the miners receive new tokens in return. This system incentivizes miners to ramp up their computing power for a better shot at winning that reward.\n\nAll that computing power is what makes blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum so energy hungry. Fortunately, there are other newer blockchains that have found different methods that use a fraction of the energy to verify transactions. Within weeks, for instance, Ethereum is expected to switch over to one of those new methods. The Merge, as the highly anticipated transition away from proof of work is called, is supposed to cut Ethereum’s energy consumption by up to 99.95 percent.\n\nBut as long as Bitcoin sticks with proof of work and remains the dominant cryptocurrency, then crypto miners will continue to pose problems. In the US, they’ve driven up electricity bills in communities where they’ve set up shop. All the hardware they use adds to piles of e-waste. And as long as fossil fuels dominate the US’s electricity mix, then energy used for crypto mining will generate air pollution that heats the planet and harms local air quality.\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/",

    "title": "Crypto Mixers: What Are They &amp; How Do They Work?",
    "selftext": "After cryptocurrencies turned up, the functioning of which is carried out in a decentralized network, Internet users could make transfers to each other without the help of intermediaries. Thanks to this, sharing personal information about yourself is unnecessary to make payments. This feature of cryptocurrencies has become one of the main arguments that their supporters put forward to justify the advantages of this technology over conventional electronic money. This advantage has a serious flaw: the cryptocurrency owner only needs to violate security measures once (for example, to purchase crypto on the exchange by a simple bank transfer) for his identity to be disclosed.\n\nAs cryptocurrencies are based on blockchain technology, which holds transactions performed inside the system into a completely transparent distributed database. If desired, any user of the system can determine how much cryptocurrency was transferred, when and to which wallets. Thus, the security of users from the point of view of anonymity is imaginary. Fortunately, anonymity adepts have created specialized services — crypto mixers. \n\n### What Is a Crypto Mixer?\n\nA crypto mixer is a service, in the form of an app or website, that mixes a certain amount of your coins with coins of other owners, after which the origin of the coins cannot be tracked. This is a way to “confuse the traces” during transactions so that no one reveals where the digital assets in the wallet came from, who they belong to and where they go. Thus, crypto mixers increase the level of security and anonymity.\n\n### Why Are Crypto Mixers Used?\n\nCryptocurrency is a convenient means of payment. With the help of cryptocurrency, fast execution of P2P transfers is ensured. The payment is unknown to the fiscal authorities, and transactions are not carried out via bank accounting registers. At the same time, information about all transactions is stored in a distributed network without reference to a specific person. Data analysis will allow you to track the chain of transfers and identify the initial or final owner.\n\nIn addition, the cryptocurrency is used for settlements on the black market, including on the Darknet.\n\nHowever, anonymizing the transfer is not always associated with illegal actions. There are reasonable reasons to hide a user’s transaction history:\n\n* Transaction security\n* The unwillingness of a particular user to show the presence of an asset\n\nCrypto mixers are used to:\n\n* Eliminate the possibility for attackers to track transactions of law-abiding owners of digital assets\n* Protect personal information\n* Protect against the theft of assets by fraudsters  \n\n\n### Types of Crypto Mixers\n\nThere are two main types of mixers — centralized and peer-to-peer.   \n\nCentralized mixers are traditional services where the mixing of coins occurs by sending a transaction and receiving the amount back in several transfers from other users selected randomly. If many people use the service, it becomes challenging to link the incoming and outgoing transactions of the same user.\n\nHowever, there are two problems with centralized mixers:\n\n* First, you need to trust the service itself. After all, it has information about user transactions and, if desired, can transfer it to third parties.\n* Secondly, there is still a small chance of falling into the hands of scammers who only disguise themselves as a mixer and simply collect user coins without sending anything in return.\n\nPeer-to-peer mixers are anonymizers that solve both problems of centralized services. Peer-to-peer mixers are platforms where owners of digital assets are grouped to form transactions. None of the participants has information about other users, mixing stages, and proportions. Transactions go through several mixes before they get to wallets. The order and number of coins are determined randomly.\n\n### How Does Crypto Mixer Work?\n\nThe algorithm for working with the mixer is quite simple and may vary slightly from service to service, but in general, everything looks like this:\n\n1. Buy crypto (if you don’t have it yet).\n2. Send coins to a crypto mixer.\n3. Coins are mixed. Here you can choose the degree/time of mixing and/or the amount of commission (all these factors are directly related to the mixing quality).\n4. You receive a letter of guarantee from the crypto mixer, which in case of problems, will help you contact technical support and figure out what’s going on because the mixer does not store or require any data about you.\n5. You get the same coins, but already from among the mixed ones.\n\nThe most crucial thing is to choose a crypto mixer so as not to send your crypto funds to scammers. To begin with, try sending a small amount to check the operation of the service, and if everything goes well, mix a large number of coins.  \n\n\n### The Legality of Using Crypto Mixers\n\nIn May 2022, the United States imposed sanctions against the popular crypto mixer Blender.io, in August — against the Tornado Cash ETH mixer. Earlier in 2020 and 2021, Helix, Coin Ninja, and Bitcoin Fog were hit.\n\nThe reason is that mixers are expected to become an effective tool for criminals. Although technologies for demixing transactions already exist, the use of services is still very common.\n\nAt the same time, mixers in most jurisdictions are not considered explicitly illegal. For example, in the USA, they are classified as money transfer services, and each of them is obliged to:\n\n* Register with FinCEN\n* Develop and implement KYC/AML measures\n* Keep records and comply with the requirements of the regulator\n\nOf course, there is little use from such mixers, where you must pass identity verification. Therefore, at the moment, no known crypto mixer would follow these rules.\n\nSince 2020, the use of mixers has increased significantly, and although the rapid growth has calmed down somewhat in 2022, it remains close to record highs. The increase is due to high volumes from centralized crypto exchanges, DeFi protocols, and addresses associated with illegal activities. According to Chainanalysis, illegal addresses account for 23% of all funds.\n\nCrypto mixers are a problematic dilemma for regulators and crypto community members. It is impossible to deny that financial privacy is the right of every person. But the data shows that cybercriminals benefit the most from such services.\n\n### Closing Thoughts\n\nThe program's advantage is hiding the history of previous transactions to get “clean” coins. However, using crypto mixers does not provide a 100% guarantee anonymity. It is possible to decipher the transaction history of a coin that has passed the mixing procedure. Clustering analysis is used for this. Clustering analysis is a special technique that helps to decipher many well-known services. So, similar algorithms were created by Bitfury and Chainalysis. With the help of clustering analysis, it becomes possible to establish interconnected crypto addresses even via a mixer.\n\nIn addition, among the programs for anonymizing digital assets, some services deceive users. It is possible to identify intruders only by reviews on forums. None of the victims will complain to the police.\n\nThanks a lot for reading!

    "selftext": "I hope this kind of question is allowed here apologies if not.\n\nHave an old ledger I got locked out of recently and thanks to past me.. I have extra valid bip words in the mix I gotta deal with. No real issue there. I already generated a list of possible 24 pair combos to work with (all passed checksum). My issue arises from trying to convert the possible seeds to their respective ypub keys. I converted my xpub key to ypub using a converter and verified my ypub on the block chain. This converter does indeed generate the proper ypub. \n\nWell I thought I was converting all seed combinations to ypub properly but it never found my real ypub in the mix. So I went and generated a brand new segwit wallet on my ledger and tried the same process to see if I could get a match. It does not generate the same ypub so the issue is with my setup. \n\nI'm doing this with python using the [bip_utils](https://github.com/ebellocchia/bip_utils/tree/f172f3c89ad77327d18cd1b5aae29d2400cb5b54) module. \n\nThis is the snippet \n\n    def convert(seed_bytes):\n\t    ADDR_NUM: int = 5\n\t    # Construct from seed\n\t    bip49_mst_ctx = Bip49.FromSeed(seed_bytes, Bip49Coins.BITCOIN)\n\t    # Derive BIP49 account keys: m/49'/0'/0'\n\t    bip49_acc_ctx = bip49_mst_ctx.Purpose().Coin().Account(0)\n\t    # Derive BIP49 chain keys: m/49'/0'/0'/0\n\t    bip49_chg_ctx = bip49_acc_ctx.Change(Bip44Changes.CHAIN_EXT)\n\n\t    pub_keys = []\n\t    priv_keys = []\n\t    addy = []\n\t    for i in range(ADDR_NUM):\n\t\t    bip49_addr_ctx = bip49_chg_ctx.AddressIndex(i)\n\t\t    pub_keys.append(bip49_addr_ctx.PublicKey().ToExtended())\n\t\t    priv_keys.append(bip49_addr_ctx.PrivateKey().ToExtended())\n\t\t    addy.append(bip49_addr_ctx.PublicKey().ToAddress())\n\n\nWas hoping maybe one of you guys could slap me upside the head for being dumb somewhere.\n\n\nupdate: I found it!!!",

    "title": "Types of Blockchains",
    "selftext": "Believe it or not, the blockchain is a philosophy, a particular attitude towards freedom, independence, and responsibility. It created a possibility to go further and widen our opportunities to manage our holdings and different money issues. So, what’s that powerful but still a bit vague thing called blockchain? Time to find that out! \n\n### Common features of blockchain technology\n\n***Blockchain*** is a virtual ledger of transactions spread around the Net and could be seen by anyone. It’s an alternative to the traditional central organizations for crypto-currency transfers like bitcoin (BTC) and others. \n\nFrom first sight, blockchain technology is just a backup network for cryptocurrencies, but it can do a lot more. Here is a list of features that make blockchain something really special. \n\n**1. Decentralized**\n\nThat means that there are no middlemen who handle the framework. A bunch of connected nodes makes it possible to leave the system decentralized.\n\nPeople can directly access blockchain using the net and have operations with their assets there. What is an asset? It could be whatever you need to have decentralized — a document, crypto, contracts, NFTs, etc. You control those things straightly without any help from intermediaries using your private key. \n\n**2. Higher level of security**\n\nAs there is nobody to govern the system, there is no room for data breaches or selling your personal information to a third party. Encryption is an extra layer of security in blockchain. \n\nCryptography is quite a complicated mathematical algorithm that protects the system from hackers’ attacks. \n\nAll the information on the platform hides the true nature of the data, so any data goes through a mathematical algorithm that makes a different kind of value, although the length is always fixed.\n\nIt’s a unique identification for every data. The blocks in the ledger have a unique hash of their own and contain the previous block’s hash. It’s impossible to change data will because it will mean you need to replace all the hash IDs. \n\n**3. Faster pace**\n\nIt’s a way faster system than a traditional one thanks to the smart contracts feature, you can have business wherever you are within a minute because you don’t depend on anybody: no queues, papers, waiting moments, and things like that. \n\n**4. Minting option**\n\nMinting is an act of producing something. With reward to the blockchain, minting mainly means, verifying information, creating a new block, and recording validated information into the blockchain. A person can mint an NFT or even a new cryptocurrency.\n\nCryptocurrency can be minted in two ways, the main difference between which is the procedure — through mining using proof-of-work (PoW) method, and the other one staking that requires proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism.\n\n**5. Distributed ledgers**\n\nIt is a database that is shared and synchronized across different websites by many people. It gives an opportunity to have public watchers so the participant can access the recordings shared across that network and have an identical copy of it. Any changes made to the ledger are traced, saved, and copied to all participants quite quickly. It is resistant to cyber attacks as everything is transparent and impossible to hide or compromise. \n\nAll the information on the ledger is stored using cryptography and can be accessed using private keys and cryptographic signatures.\n\nDistributed ledgers reduce operational inefficiencies, make transactions way faster, and above all, they are automated, although they work 24/7 all over the world, which reduces expenses. \n\n**6. Immutability**\n\nThat stands for unchangeability. Once the object is immutable, it cannot be changed after its creation. \n\nImmutable transactions make it impossible for any intermediary to manipulate, replace, or fake data stored on the network. This option makes the system trusty and cost-effective.\n\nImmutability is reached by hashing and encrypting. What do those weird words mean? Let’s have a look at it. \n\n1. A hash function takes existing data and output, a so-called “checksum” — a combination of numbers and letters that is considered as a digital signature.\n2. The Checksum must match your exact data input — if even one piece is different between two files, the outputs after hashing will be two different combinations, so any change in your input can sharply change your output.\n3.  It’s impossible to work backward from an output string to regulate the input data. \n\nAs for encryption, it’s a way of protecting data by encoding it mathematically so it can be read or decrypted by the person who has a correct key or cipher. Encryption is important to keep private information, messages, and transactions private safe and sound.\n\n### Types of blockchain platforms\n\n* **a public blockchain** \n\nIn a public blockchain like Bitcoin, absolutely anyone can join and participate in the main activities of the blockchain network. All the participants can read, write, and audit the current activities on the network, which helps a public blockchain to host its self-governed nature.\n\nThe public network operates on an incentivizing scheme that encourages new participants to join and keep the network flexible. Public blockchains make it possible to have a decentralized, democratized, and intermediary-free operation.\n\nThere are some cons, though — the first, power consumption that is necessary to maintain the distributed public ledger. The second is the lack of complete privacy and anonymity that can be a purpose to the weaker security level of the network and of the participant's identity. \n\nTo become a part of a public blockchain, a participant creates an account and connects it to a node. \n\nWho decides to add or not to add a transaction? It's decided by consensus. That means that the transaction must be accepted by the majority of \"nodes\" (or computers in the network). \n\n* **a private or permissioned blockchain**\n\nBlockchains of this kind mix public and private blockchains and offer customization options. It includes allowing anyone to join the network after verification of their identity and issuing of selected permissions to perform only certain activities on the network. Ripple (one of the most prominent cryptocurrencies) and Hyperledger offers permission-based roles for participants. That means the users can read, access, and write information on the blockchains. \n\nThe central authority of such a blockchain determines who can be a node.  That authority can grant or don’t grant each node equal rights to perform functions.  Private blockchains are partially decentralized because public access to them is forbidden. \n\nIt’s worth mentioning, private blockchains are frequently an object of interest for scammers. \n\nLet’s highlight the main features of the running of a private blockchain network:\n\n* Users of the network and their rights are not equal. \n* Different categories of data are only open for users who have been granted authorization. \n* The way of access is defined by the network participants' regulations.\n* **a consortium blockchain**\n\nSuch blockchains are permissioned blockchains controlled by a group of organizations. Consortium blockchains are more decentralized than private blockchains and have a higher level of security. \n\nInstead of a public option in which anybody can validate blocks or a private one in which only a single party selects block producers, a consortium blockchain gives an opportunity for a small number of equally influential parties as validators.\n\nThis type of blockchain could be helpful when several same industry companies need one platform to make transactions or share information. Examples of such are Quorum and Corda.\n\nA consortium blockchain is more safe, scalable, and efficient but yet less transparent. \n\n* **a hybrid blockchain**\n\nIt’s supposed to absorb the best of two blockchain technologies. This allows participants to hold decentralization and gain management of personal data and improve performance. The benefits include the liquidity and market access of public blockchain with enjoying the privacy and safety benefits of private blockchain. \n\n### What is blockchain used for? \n\n* **Banking and finance**\n\nThe banking sphere is quite rigid, but the blockchain is, on the contrary, is flexible and adaptive, it never sleeps and doesn’t have weekends or holidays. Transactions and money operations running through banks could be quite time-consuming, and in the case of blockchain, it usually takes about 10 minutes to have your transaction done.  Banking can adopt blockchain’s features such as its infrastructure, security, and payments system. \n\n* **Currency**\n\nIn the case of a central authority system, a user’s personal data and currency are under a  bank or government control. If a user’s bank is hacked, the client’s private information is at risk. If the client’s bank collapses or the client lives in a country with an unstable economy, the value of their currency is very volatile. \n\nBy spreading its operations across a network of computers, blockchain allows cryptocurrencies to run without a central authority. This reduces both — risks and also the processing and transaction fees. It can also give those in countries with unstable currencies or financial infrastructures a more stable currency with more applications and a wider network of individuals and institutions with whom they can do business, both domestically and internationally.\n\n* **Healthcare**\n\nHealthcare providers can use blockchain to store their patients’ medical documentation safely. When they are generated and signed, they can be stored on the blockchain, which gives patients the proof and confidence that the information cannot be changed, stolen, or compromised. These records could be encoded, stored, and accessed on the blockchain with a private key that can be used only by a person who owns it.  \n\n* **Real estate** \n\nThis process of conducting special property documents is time- and cost-consuming and also involves the human factor, so each inaccuracy makes tracking property ownership less efficient. Blockchain has the potential to eliminate the need for scanning documents and tracking down physical files in a local recording office. If property ownership is stored and verified on the blockchain, owners can trust that their deed is accurate and permanently recorded.\n\n* **Smart contracts**\n\nA smart contract is a piece of a computer program or a protocol that performs automatically. Smart contracts run under pre-agreed conditions. Once those conditions are met, the terms of the agreement are immediately starting working. \n\nThis is supposed to lower the fees and ease the processes typically associated with the use of an organization, third-party mediator, or a broker. It also makes managing business on blockchain easier and safer. \n\n* **Voting**\n\nVoting with blockchain wants to forbid election fraud and improve voter turnout. The blockchain protocol would also provide transparency in the electoral process. This would remove the necessity for recounts or any real fraud. Some countries such as Russia, Estonia, and the USA have already tested the system. \n\nSource - [https://simplehold.io/blog/article/types-of-blockchains?utm\\_source=social&amp;utm\\_medium=reddit&amp;utm\\_campaign=education\\_post](https://simplehold.io/blog/article/types-of-blockchains?utm_source=social&amp;utm_medium=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=education_post)",

    "selftext": "I really see no one talking about merged-mining in this space, most probably because 90% of people doesn't know it exist, and the other part just doesn't really understand it.\n\nI'm also not truly super technical about it, but looking at it and the future of BTC, it really resonates with it.\n\n**What is Merged Mining then?**\n\n\"Merged mining is a sustainable security solution, much like entering multiple lotteries with a single ticket, merged mining allows users to take the BTC hash for a current block and apply it to different blockchains. With these additional rewards, there is more incentive for miners to participate and cause hashrate and overall network security to increase proportionately, with benefits to all participants.\" Quote from GMMA.\n\nSo we can almost say that merged mining is a form of green PoW, because you're not using more resources to mine, you're using the same hashrate.\nNot only that but if you're merged mined with BTC, you will also inherit its security.\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith this in mind, and knowing that BTC will keep halving \"forever\", how can the future be sustainable for miners to keep mining? I know a lot of people say that BTC will increase in price accordingly and transactions fees will be sufficient, but we are not really sure of that, and I really think merged-mining will be the solution.\n\nThere aren't many projects that use BTC Merged-Mining, right now, the only ones I know about are Syscoin and Jax Network. This is because Syscoin and Jax started something called \"GMMA\" (Global Merged Mining Aliance), the main goal being to bring merged mining education to everyone.\n\n“The beauty of merged mining is that we can re-apply all of our hashing power to support multiple networks and build a thriving software ecosystem at the same time,” said Jag Sidhu, Syscoin Lead Developer and Foundation President. “However, merged mining is currently relatively unknown, under developed, and under-utilised. The GMMA is here to change this.”.",

It's also a dual-layered Blockchain, the first one (L1) being this one merge-mined with BTC and running in tandem with it is the L2 one which is the EVM Based Blockchain, called NEVM, which provides smart-contract functionality.\n\nBy being merge-mined with btc, it basically means that 20% of BTC Hash power goes into mining Syscoin, at no extra cost. It also grants Syscoin the Gold Standart Security from BTC.\n\nSo its basically ETH+BTC Combined, since it also has 100% compatibility with every smart contract on eth.\n\nSyscoin recently also announced their new project, named Rollux. Rollux will enable layer 2 scaling technologies on top of Syscoin's smart contracts, starting with Optimistic roll-ups before expanding to ZK-rollups. This means super scalability coming.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMain question: How do you feel about it? Does it have a place in the current market?\n\nWhat's your thoughts on it ?",

Previous attempts to do this like Cassacius coins (2011) printed the private key under an imperfect tamper evident seal making circulation problematic. With an electronic solution here one can rekey your cash notes. This style of hardware wallet is novel and an important advancement which lets cryptocurrencies more effectively compete with Fiat currencies.\n\nWould love your feedback and answer questions here.",

I tend to think \"Bitcoin Maxxis\" or more broadly PoW &gt; PoS arguments get many things right but I do notice they sometimes don't feel the need to take their arguments too deeply, so I would like to offer the opportunity to do that.\n\nThere are surely many interesting arguments on both sides that are rarely explored, like:\n\n* Don't the wealthiest miners also have the ability to control Bitcoin in a similar fashion? How significant is the fact that hash power is external to the network while stake is internal?\n\n* Slashing solves the fundamental attack of PoS, the \"nothing at stake attack.\" What are the downsides to slashing and why isn't PoS with slashing the standard if it readily makes PoS secure?\n\n* Do staking pools which offer liquid capital in exchange for the staked native token/coin threaten to centralize the network?\n\n* Similarly, do DeFi protocols which offer more return on the base asset than staking does threaten to funnel coins away from staking, where they bolster security, to lending protocols, where they do not?\n\nI'm not looking to affirm any preconceptions, but if you feel passionately about any of this I'd like to hear why and I'm willing to read or watch anything offering to go in depth into this discussion. I understand Ethereum is the de-facto leader on the subject (even if they aren't quite there yet) and that their proposals aren't always simple; I personally have decent experience researching blockchain technology and cryptography and am willing to go  down any rabbit holes offered, so don't be shy to get technical. \n\nThanks in advance.",

I'll explain my hypothesis using two countries, Turkey and Norway. Turkey's average annual inflation for [April 2022 is 69.9%](https://tradingeconomics.com/turkey/inflation-cpi). Norway's average annual inflation for [April 2022 is 5.4%](https://tradingeconomics.com/norway/inflation-cpi).\n\nSay Turkey and Norway compete on exporting maritime ships to the EU. With ≈ 70% inflation in Turkey their ships would theoretically be more competitive than Norway because of lower prices, but since Turkish businesses can't buy the most [advanced, expensive foreign tech anymore](https://www.businessinsider.com/lira-plunge-turks-cant-buy-iphones-other-electronics-2021-11?r=US&amp;IR=T), their ships lose quality and competetiveness long-term. If all parties exclusively traded in Bitcoin every nation would try to export as much as possible while importing as little as possible, so they have BTC net inflows that they can stack to keep their economy running. The moment Turkey's economy is disrupted into a trade deficit, it will cause a slow-but-inevetable death sprial of BTC net outflows. Workers (rightfully) demand the same pay as last month, but as companies gradually drain their own wallets they simply run out of Sats to pay their employees without enormous layoffs.\n\nHowever, employees and Turkey can be saved from this death-spiral by using their own hard currency that competes against Norway and the EU's individual hard currencies. Say Turkey's fictional \"TurkCoin\" follows [Bitcoin's current annual inflation rate of 1.7%](https://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-inflation/), Turkey's currency would forever be saved from hyperinflation, unsustainable leverage and losing international buying-power. Each hard currency represents the value and strength of the country using it, so if Turkey ended up in a trade deficit, TurkCoin would temporarily devalue against Norway's NorCoin due to less demand.\n\nLess demand with 1.7% inflation will cause a slight (manageable) devaluation, but make Turkish companies temporarily more competitive against Norway. They can increase exports as their products become cheaper internationally, and the economy will grow organically again - regaining its valuation after demand picks back up. TurkCoin, NorCoin and EuroCoin would act like pendulums that naturally balance each other out during hard times - providing relief for the disrupted economy while making sure no single nation can debt-fuel itself unsustainably past the others and exporting its own inflation internationally. \\*looking at you [USA](https://www.usdebtclock.org/)\\*\n\nThe problem even with low modern inflation is its creation through debt, giving us the classic boom and bust cycles. Even with demand and inflation being equal and the currency not devaluing, we would still end up in a highly leveraged position after some time. Zombie companies would outcompete solid companies, not by having a sustainable business model but by leveraging themselves beyond reason like [Evergrande Group](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/09/business/china-evergrande-default.html). This robs rational planners while benefitting the short-sighted risk takers.\n\nClosing words: Only with predictable inflation created by mining/staking can we achieve fair market competition across the globe. What coins do you think will become the next international currencies and why?\n\nEdit: Grammar",

At a time when the fight against climate change requires immediate action, the mining industry continues to emit between 4-7% of global greenhouse gasses (GHG)1. In fact, scientists estimate that the industrial activity needed to mine just one ounce of gold causes the emission of up to 800 kilograms of GHG2!\n\nObviously, technological evolution brought many alternatives, one in the form of cryptocurrencies. But then, everything comes at a cost. And cryptos aren’t growing on trees.\n\nAccording to the University of Cambridge, Bitcoin mining alone generates about 132.48 terawatt-hours (TWh) annually and the CO2 emitted by this varies on how that energy was created. In fact, in 2020, the US generated 0.85 pounds of carbon dioxide per kWh, which resulted in nearly 40 billion tons of carbon dioxide produced by US Bitcoin mining alone!\n\nOpening their eyes to the harrowing impact of this “new currency”, a lot of cryptocurrencies are trying to come up with alternative mining solutions, that would require less energy and could provide solutions to problems such as the need to accelerate ESG investments that can preserve the environment or the need for a secure, net-zero bridge between a dominant real-world store of value,i.e., gold, and the crypto asset world, without the environmental and social impact of either real-world mining or Proof of Work mining.\n\nCompanies are coming up with new investment alternatives including a tokenized\nInvestments like Nature’s Vault are backed by the preservation of at least 1/100th of a gram of gold in the ground, thereby ensuring forests, ground soil, and their associated ecosystems are not disturbed by gold mines, fossil fuels are not burned in mining activities and local and indigenous communities are not harmed by collateral impacts such as heavy metals contamination of groundwater, rivers, and lakes.\n\nBut do you think it’s enough?

    "selftext": "As an active crypto user, it makes me super annoyed to use 4, 5 or more applications at once. One wallet does not support bitcoin segwit but supports TRON, another one only applies Cosmos Network, and etc. I came across an article by Bob Stewell \"Do Unhosted Wallets Dream of Network Fees?\". He argues that due to the fact that blockchains do not reward crypto-wallets they are not in a hurry to make a multi-currency crypto-wallet, which are needed for comfortable usage.\n\nHere where I came to understanding why all those problems are happening. For example, I realized why there are huge purchase fees and a bad exchange rate in wallets. We often have to refer to p2p, CEXs, and DEXs just because of it. In case someone out of the crypto world needs to explain how to switch from one currency to another, the disaster is happening. Oh, I guess the support is the main issue here! At the beginning of my crypto way, I was waiting for answers for several days, and as a result, I’ve figured everything out by myself.\n\nEvery time a new blockchain project that is not supported by one or another wallet is released you have to install a specific application. \n\nThere are many places where the wallet is imported via a 12-word seed phrase, and a 24-word seed phrase is often found in new ones ... Is it so difficult to make a choice? And then I found out that these seed phrases may be in different languages! Even in Chinese, and not all wallets support it also! As for me, I have been using cryptocurrencies for more than 5 years now and I see that wallets are developing really slow. It got so bad that I'm already thinking of developing a wallet myself. \n\nBob believes that the problem essence is in the monetization model - wallets live off a percentage of the purchase or exchange. Adding all the variety of blockchains for wallets is resource-intensive, and wallet revenues will not grow much from this. For me as a user, the problem is really serious, since the ecosystems of Ethereum, Cosmos, Solana, Polygon, and others are actively developing, and it is impossible to use them all in one wallet.\n\nFrankly, it is much more natural for a wallet that offers a variety of blockchains to provide a range of payment systems and exchangers. But no one does this, because the more profitable this exchange for the user is, the less the wallet’s profit is, or there is even no profit at all. This is a bad system.\n\nThe problem is in the blockchains themselves: they pay miners, they pay stackers, but they don't pay wallets. It seems to me that blockchains can change this situation and start stimulating wallets, and this will give an impetus to development, and strengthen competition. Wallets will fight each other to become number 1! To make the most convenient and intuitive interface (this is a problem for many wallets). \n\nThe solution is the integration of the mechanism into the blockchain, which will send part of the network transaction fee to the wallet that helped the user to carry out this transaction. Then the functionality and service of wallets will improve significantly. What do you think about it?",

The fundamental difference between Bitcoin and Decred is that the latter uses a hybrid PoW/PoS consensus.

The most popular one is that the subsidy to PoS will increase to 80%, while the subsidy to PoW decreases to 10%.  This will give DCR stakers a 10% APY, which is very high, and DCR staking doesn't require custody, so there's no counterparty risk.

We've tried to break this up with things like plasma and sharding but only recently has it become incredibly clear that this is the future or at least the present with rollups and data availability chains like the upcoming Polygon avail.\n\nBut, first, what exactly is a monolithic blockchain? To oversimplify, a blockchain performs three basic functions: execution, security, and data availability. For the longest time, a blockchain had to do everything itself, which resulted in crippling inefficiencies, as reflected in the blockchain trilemma. Bitcoin and Ethereum chose to be highly secure and decentralized while sacrificing scalability, whereas other chains made different choices. \n\nModular chains no longer have to carry the weight of doing everything by itself thus eliminating inefficiencies. So instead of having one monolithic chain, we have three different types or layers.\n\n**Execution**, which is what users interact with and where all the transactions happen. You won't be able to tell the difference between this and a monolithic blockchain. Rollups are the most important execution layers, but there are also validiums and volitions. Arbitrum One currently has a significant time-to-market advantage, with Polygon looking to drop 4 ZK rollups this year. Both A1 and Polygon's ZK chains, however, are in their early stages. There are more of course and I think the execution layers are going to be the more highly competitive.\n\n**Security** is by far the most difficult layer of the three. At the moment, there are only two solutions that are sufficiently secure and decentralized, or are attempting to be so: Bitcoin and Ethereum. Most other chains failed to anticipate the blockchain legos tsunami and made crippling sacrifices to security and/or decentralization in order to achieve greater scalability. \n\n**Data availability** Ethereum also has the best long-term roadmap for data availability, both in terms of technology with KZG commitments and data availability sampling, but also in terms of sheer brute force, leveraging its industry-leading security chain to deploy a large number of data shard chains.\n\nHowever, Ethereum's data availability layer is likely to be 18 months away. Validiums and volitions can benefit from Ethereum's security in the short term while committing transaction data (in compressed form) to separate data availability layers. We have data availability chains such as Polygon Avail, Celestia, and zkPorter, as well as committees such as StarkEx's DAC that will pick up the slack and have every chance of building network effects. Some of these chains are also security chains, which should be noted. \n\nAt the end of the day I believe we are entering a new era of how or blockchain is built and I feel like it is an incredible step forward into the right direction, curious to hear your thoughts.",

So i understand the blockchain trilemma is this idea that a blockchain needs to be decentralized, scalable, and secure but developers are needing to sacrifice on some ends to make up for others...\n\n1. What is an example of developers sacrificing security for decentralization and scalability? Or does decentralization (more nodes) just account for this? Im assuming they overlap but aren't the same thing\n2. How are L2 solutions actually a solution? If a layer 2 solution is centralized then how is this any different than using traditional finance  with extra steps?\n3. Im going to horribly butcher this stat but I heard it somewhere and its driving me crazy. It was something like \"Bitcoin in 13 years has 300GB of storage for it's entire blockchain - in less than a year Solana already takes up 2TB.\" I'm sure I'm way off here... but why is this? Why does Solana require so much more data? \n\nI feel like I'm piecing some of this together but I'd love to hear your thoughts or see what resources you recommend for learning. Thanks everyone!",

    "title": "Increasing liquidity by improving limit orders",
    "selftext": "As crypto currency becomes more scalable, the trend is moving away from automated market makers and towards the orderbook model that centralised exchanges use. Many small exchanges struggle with thin orderbooks that drives users away, compounding the issue. I will outline a system that could greatly increase the thickness of orderbooks without requiring users to have more funds, allowing for a more efficient use of capital.\n\nIn the standard system, I can place any number of limit orders as long as they do not sum to greater than what's in my account. If I have 100 USDT in my account, I could simultaneously have a bid with 80 USDT for BTC at 28500 and a bid with 20 USDT for ETH at 1850. I could not have a bid for 90 USDT for BTC at 28500  and a 50 USDT bid for ETH at 1850 at the same time because that would sum to 140 USDT, which exceeds the 100 USDT in my account.\n\nIn the system I am proposing, the only restriction is that the amount of a users limit orders in any given pair does not exceed the amount in their account - the sum of the total bids/asks you place across multiple pairs is not considered. So it would be possible for someone with 100 USDT in their account place a 90 USDT bid for BTC at 28500 and a bid with 50 USDT for ETH at 1850 even though they had only 100 USDT in their account because for each pair BTC/USDT and ETH/USDT, 100 USDT is not exceeded.\n\nIn this new system, once a limit order was partially or completely filled, the system would immediately re-check all the limit orders of the person whose limit order was partially or completely filled, and make sure they followed the rule that the limit orders in any given pair did not exceed the amount in their account. If they did not exceed that value, nothing would happen, and if they did exceed then the limit orders in that pair would be lowered (in order of best to worst) so that they no longer did. This ensures that all limit orders can be filled correctly without users ever ending up with a negative balance.\n\nHere's a scenario in the new system: a person has placed these 3 bids and has 100 USDT in their account.\n\n1. 90 USDT bid for BTC at 32000 \n2. 50 USDT bid for ETH at 2000\n3. 20 USDT bid for ETH at 1800\n\nEven though the sum is 160 USDT, these bids are to be in the orderbook at the same time because the 160 total is not exceeded when looking at one pair at a time. Here's 2 cases of them being filled.\n\n1. Someone partially fills the BTC/USDT bid with 23 USDT of volume. The BTC/USDT bid is reduced from 90 to 67 USDT. The user is left with 77 USDT in their account. It then checks that no pair exceeded 77 USDT of bids: the ETH/USDT bids sum only to 70 USDT, so no change would be made to them.\n2. Someone partially fills the BTC/USDT bid with 82 USDT of volume. The BTC/USDT bid would be reduced from 90 to 8 USDT. The user is left with 18 USDT in their account. It then checks that no pair exceeds 18 USDT of bids. The ETH/USDT bids sum to 70 USDT, so they must be reduced. The system lowers the bids by going from best to worst. First it eats through the entire 50 USDT ETH bid at 2000, then lowers the 20 USDT bid at 1800 to 18 USDT.\n\nThe greatest factor this system could increase thickness by is equal to the number of pairs on the exchange. With 100 USDT on an exchange that has 50 USDT pairs, you could place bids that sum to 5000 USDT. If one was completely filled, all those bids would disappear - but the bids were real. They weren't superficial. Anyone wanting to fill those orders could have filled them. This system doesn't result with phantom bids/asks that don't exist. They are all just as real as normal, the difference is that when they get filled they can affect bids/asks in other pairs too.\n\nThis system would definitely be more intensive on the hardware doing the order matching, but modern hardware is more than capable of handling it. Another thing to note is it would typically increase the thickness of bids more than asks, because the bids are usually denoted in the more popular currency. If DOGE/USDT is the only pair on the exchange with DOGE and the user has 4000 DOGE, there's only 1 pair the can use their DOGE in, they can't use that DOGE to make a limit order in the BTC/USDT pair - so in this case the new system doesn't enable them to make more limit orders.\n\nTo further improve the system, there could be alternate rules about how the system automatically modifies users limit orders when the amount gets exceeded. Instead of best-to-worst, a worst-to-best system could be used, or a proportionate system that lowers all bids equally until the amount isn't exceeded could be used - and these would all be selectable by the user.\n\nI haven't seen this system used on any exchange, are there any out there that use this approach?

I think from a banker's perspective, the system is already decentralized to a degree because banks have no reason to trust each other too much.\n\nConsensus is also fairly expensive. At the very least it sets a lower bound on the speed at which transactions can be accepted: the signal must travel to the other end of the world and back, that's 100ms of latency. This should be unnecessary for local payments.\n\nAre there already protocols that do not rely on maintaining full worldwide consensus?",

One wallet could have a bitcoin in it. I could tell that wallet to send the one bitcoin over to my other wallet. Since I own both wallets, no true transaction is needed off the blockchain.\n\nHowever, when one wants to exchange their bitcoin for FIAT, the process must include an extra step of binding/sending FIAT as well. \n\nMy question is: how is this achieved? And how WAS this achieved?\n\nFor added context/discussion: was it \"easy\" to buy bitcoins in 2009? I wanted to buy bitcoin for years, but I didn't even know how to. I realize now that CEXs make it very easy. But this front end development is a recent invention. So in the early stages of bitcoin, how did people add Bitcoins to their wallets, if not for mining? And when they sold their bitcoin, how did they actually get FIAT? \n\nThanks for any information.",

So would it be possible to create a crypto that has the stable aspect of the stable coin and the anti-inflationary aspect of other cryptos?\n\nCould a stable coin be pegged to, for example, 1:1 with USD to start and then increase its USD value based on the amount of inflation experienced by USD every year?

    "selftext": "Repost:\n\nIn any blockchain, take bitcoin for example, the previous block's hash is added to the new block. This makes it so that the order of blocks cannot be changed. In other words, it creates an immutable and chronological sequence of events. A \"proof of history,\" if you will...\n\nAm I missing something, or is this no different from what bitcoin and any other blockchains do with hashes in blocks?\n\nAfter reading deeper into it it seems like the main difference is that instead of having a node find a block and broadcast it to all other nodes who then individually audit the TXs in the new block and individually cross-reference each other, Solana chooses a \"leader\" validator via PoS who finds a block, broadcasts it to all other nodes and then tallies the votes from all the other nodes themselves rather than all nodes cross-referencing each other's votes and determining the majority decision (i.e. broad consensus)\n\nit seems like this \"leader\" model where one party counts votes and determines consensus instead of all nodes reviewing all other nodes' votes and determining majority consensus, is what sets it apart and allows for massive throughput and speed.\n\nPLS correct me if I am off or just way wrong on this. I've been trying to understand exactly what PoH is for hours today and outside of the whitepaper, I can't find any decent material that really breaks it down in an honest and simple way. Everywhere I see it written about it is described as this massive innovation but it seems to be exactly the process of hashing in sha256 and new blocks having the hash from old blocks. In fact, it sounds like it is literally proof of work just rebranded.\n\nAlso, I hate to get all fuddy, but if I am correct then this system obviously sacrifices vast amounts of decentralization for speed/scalability far beyond arguments commonly seen around crypto subs like hardware requirements, token distribution, etc.\n\nSomeone responded with this [writeup](https://notes.ethereum.org/@dankrad/BJywSZY9t), but this is just out of reach of my technical level. I'm basically looking for this but a bit more dumbed down.\n\np.s. I currently hold SOL\n\nedit: is another key difference that solana creates a hash for each individual TX which then gets stamped on the next incoming TX? Rather than just having a whole block of TXs have the hash of the previous TX and its own new hash?\n\nIf so, how does this process specifically save time unless it's like I said above where nodes just send votes to a leader who counts them instead of signaling them to all other nodes and nodes collectively coming to a majority consensus? It seems to just forego a major step there?\n\nThanks to anyone willing to help me here..",

This fee is **burned** after transaction is made, resulting in Ether becoming **deflationary asset** \n2. **tip**:  sometimes called an optional tip, but in reality it's **not optional**, it will have to be paid. This tip go to the miners.\n\nSo by this, the Ethereum transaction fees are high because the majority of each fee is burned to **make** **Ether deflationary asset**, because **Ether doesn't have a capped supply** \\- meaning unlike Bitcoin, which is capped at 21 million coins, Ether has no such limit. \n\nThis is probably good for Ether holders but I cant understand why is this solution good for ordinary user or the projects running on Ethereum as everybody is just crying for lower fees. \n\nNext planned solution for smaller fees in Ethereum network is to move majority of transaction off the main chain into Layer2 is also quite controversial ....\n\nWhat is your though about that?",

    "title": "Could there by a use for \"nondeterministic\" operations determined by block producer?",
    "selftext": "Suppose for the context some blockchain or something in many ways like a blockchain which has a smart contract instruction set (at least analogous to EVM instruction set, or Bitcoin opcodes I suppose).  \n\nNow, aiui, there are already things even in Bitcoin such that what exactly a transaction does depends on the settings of the miner who mines the block. (I haven't checked whether on Bitcoin one can use this to do things other than just \"send some amount of coins to whatever address the block producer lists as their address\" but, this does at least have some dependency on what the block producer chose.).  \n\nBut, my question is whether it could potentially be useful to have instructions which expand this influence substantially (when requested by the code being executed as part of the transaction).  \n\nThat is, (now, again thinking more on the \"EVM instructions used in a smart contract\" side of the scale than the \"Bitcoin opcodes\" side of the scale), suppose there was an instruction which would request some number of bytes from the mining software, perhaps with a hint for what kind of source these bytes should be from, which the mining software would insert. These bytes provided by the miner would be included in the block so that others validating the blocks could check that the transaction was executed in a valid way, but there would be no technical restriction on what bytes the miner can provide.  \n\nFor example, the smart contract could request untrusted-random bytes from the miner. These would not be trustworthy, because if the miner benefited from manipulating them, well, they can choose them to be whatever they want. But, if the benefit of the randomness is just for efficiency of execution, and having no bearing as to the part of the result which is the point of the smart contract, then if the smart contract+transaction was set up such that the miner was no worse off by providing random bytes than if they manipulated the bytes provided to make the contract run inefficiently, then perhaps miners could be expected to set their mining software to provide random bytes in these cases?\n\nOr, instead, suppose the miner is likely to have access to some information which the smart contract can cheaply verify, but which cannot be cheaply computed by the smart contract, and which requires information that the person sending the transaction does not have at the time that they send the transaction (but which the miner of a block including the transaction would be likely to know. Or, alternatively, which their mining software would be likely to know.)  \nThen, the smart contract could request the bytes, check if the bytes provided satisfy the condition, and if so, reward the miner, and if not, abort and quit early (to avoid additional gas fees).\n\n(which type of request is being made could be determined by an additional hint parameter, even though from the perspective of validating a block these two things would be equivalent)\n\n\n(I was originally thinking of such an operation in the context of many interlinked permission-ed chains, each with a single block producer, but where there are links between the different chains where each chain has associated with it a smart contract on a number of the other chains which holds some collateral which, if presented with proof that the one chain has acted invalidly, gives a payout to make whole the person presenting the proof, but, I thought the concept might also be applicable more broadly, and actually, probably more applicable more generally than in the case I was originally thinking of.  \nNote that I'm not claiming that the security of the original thing I was thinking of works out. I'm quite unsure of that. This post isn't meant to advocate for that idea.)\n\n**So, my question:** Do you have any arguments for why this would \"(almost) never be a good instruction to support\" ? Do you see any good use-cases that stand out to you?    \n\nI suppose that if one wants some random bytes and is not concerned whether they can be manipulated by an adversary, then just using the hash of the previous block could suffice for that.  \nBut, also, if a smart contract set things up such that choosing the \"random\" bytes maliciously was never beneficial to the miner, then perhaps the first case could be used in situations where \"random\" bytes would suffice, but where a benevolent choice of bytes would be even better for both the author of the contract and the miner, and so, miner software could use random values for it (or just previous block hash), but such that if the miner software could easily enough analyze which values would be even better than random, use that?  \n\nIn that case, the hint for which type of non-determinism is requested, could serve as a hint to mining software of either \"just giving me a random value is sufficient here (though I'd appreciate a carefully chosen value~)\" or \"unless you give me a carefully chosen value that actually works for me, including this transaction won't give you nearly as much miner reward, so unless you are going to do that, it is in your best interest to not include this transaction\".\n\n____________________\n\n\n**An almost entirely separate thought:**\n\nHm, so, I know there are instructions for \"actually, revert all the changes that this transaction made (including any calls to other contracts it may have made), except for gas fees\".  \n\nBut, if there was an instruction that meant \"if this instruction is executed as part of a transaction, then that transaction cannot be included in a valid block\", well... I suppose that miners likely would choose not to even *consider* including transactions which involve a contract that have such a instruction.  \nBut if there were such an instruction, and some mining software could easily check whether certain transactions would with high confidence not hit that instruction, perhaps it could still be worth checking in those cases? But perhaps it could allow an attack where miners are spammed with potential transactions that they would have to take the time to check if the transactions involve a contract with such an instruction anywhere in it in order to reject it, and this would be too costly even to do that extra check, even without trying to check if the transaction would actually hit the instruction.  \n\nOh, another issue is if like, one contract does a computation to determine what other contract to call, and the other contract potentially calls a contract which includes this instruction. That would be rather exploitable. That's no good. I suppose this could be handled by saying that if a contract calls another contract which includes this instruction, then the transaction immediately ends but with all the gas costs so far still being paid. (or, alternatively, the miner can choose whether to do that, or to continue. But I'd imagine most would do that and not continue, unless there was a big reward.) That way, miners would only have to check if the first contract to be called contains the instruction in order to decide whether they want to consider attempting the transaction.\n\nThe small connection between these two ideas is that like, if you had both, then in the second type of non-determinism, that way you could have a contract that basically says \"query an oracle(the miner) for bytes that satisfy these criteria. If the results do not match the criteria, then they never happened, and not even gas fees are paid.\" . And, that seems like it could be useful.  \n\nOf course, one could always set things up so that in one transaction, you set the criteria and provide payment for a reward, and then another transaction (likely by someone else) can provide the required information, and then receives the provided reward, and the computation continues. But this way of doing it would span multiple blocks, so, e.g. this couldn't be done inside a flash loan, or other things that need to be done within a single transaction.\n\n...\n\nSorry this was kind of stream of consciousness and disjointed.",

So 'n' attempts later the miner pops out 0023456789 OR instead of solving placeholder by placeholder does a miner just keep mining until some 'nth' time solving the algo a 000456789 comes out? meaning they could have previously gotten a 0042489273 then 238472348 then 029438523984 and so on an so forth until they finally get the correct number of leading zeros?\n\nI hope all that makes sense and I know this probably sounds totally stupid and it probably is, but the reason I want to know is because for a school project I'm doing on crypto/bitcoin I thought it'd be cool to make a simulated recording of the blockchain solving/\"mining\" a block, but I don't really understand this part and I want the simulation to be accurate so people don't learn the wrong thing and say I'm dumb.",

    "selftext": "I did some math in another thread discussing the viability of using green energy for pouring bitcoin. I don't think it's possible or responsible with the current state of renewable. Below is my math and take on the renewable energy discussion. Please provide some critiques and comments:\n\nThe state of Bitcoin mining energy consumption is 197 TWh/year. A US home consumes 10,700 kWh/year or 10,700,000 Wh/year, meaning the energy consumption of 18.4 MILLION US homes.\n\nThe level of adoption of the bicoin network is currently ONLY 79 million. What will happen when adoption reaches a billion users? 2 billion users? Let's say the energy consumption scales linearly with the amount of users and miners on the network. That's roughly a 25x increase in consumption for 2 billion users, but I have a feeling this will not scale linearly, since the amount of activity on the network will be exponential rather than linear. \n\nA conservative 25x increase in consumption will equal 4,925 TWh/year, or 4,925,000 GWh/ year, the equivalent current yearly energy consumption of the US and Russia COMBINED. This is not FUD, it's basic math, and adding more solar panels or wind turbines to power it all will not be able to meet the energy demands of running the network.\n\nSolar and wind are too intermittent to act as baseload to power a system that needs to run at full capacity 24x7, even with the introduction of batteries to extend the energy production and reduce volatility. They can certainly supplement the consumption, but cannot be reliable sources of energy baseload.\n\nHydro is certainly a consistent source of energy baseload to power the network, but the amount of locations and energy potential is surely too limited to support the amount of energy needed to run the network. Geothermal can be used, but now we're talking about billion dollar capital projects to build those plants, including heavy civil, structural, and electrical work to build, including full time staff and maintenance workers to man the plants and maintain their upkeep.  Multiply that by a few hundred of those plants and maybe you can run the network with the demand discussed above. if we wanted to start considering the energy consumption implications of 3-4 billion users my head starts to spin..\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption/\n\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/647374/worldwide-blockchain-wallet-users/\n\nhttps://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&amp;t=3#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20the%20average%20annual,about%20893%20kWh%20per%20month.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_consumption",

Then, it explores the natural evolution of DeFi as we know it. Advancing from Ethereum and other pockets of DeFi to a more robust Bitcoin-based solution could allow millions to participate in the most egalitarian redistribution of wealth in history. **Bitcoin and DeFi can solve the problem of unbanked people and also provide an alternative to current banking systems, which are not accessible to some.**\n\nIt also mentions that statistics in countries like Mexico, the Philippines, or Vietnam show that people want an alternative to traditional banking accounts. **Could Bitcoin DeFi be the right choice for these people?** It also delivers a fact that with the upcoming years of the Metaverse phenomenon, Bitcoin is perfectly positioned to be the sound money of the upcoming digital era.\n\nRead the article [here](https://hackernoon.com/defi-on-bitcoin-how-sovryn-is-answering-the-final-criticism-against-bitcoin).\n\n* Part 1 - Prologue and Introduction\n* Part 2 - DeFi CeFi comparison\n* Part 3 - Benefits of a Bitcoin-based DeFi system\n* Part 4 - Meet Sovryn, the most feature-rich platform for Bitcoin DeFi\n* Part 5 - Prerequisites for the Bitcoin DeFi and outro\n\n*“States and people that embrace this Bitcoin globalization will benefit from the prosperity and freedom it creates.

The common critique is the energy consumption from PoW chains, and these people generally don't even bother to research about the subject more after coming to the conclusion \"cryptocurrency bad because it uses too much energy\". So I've been thinking about what a great PR move it will be for ethereum when they move to PoS, and I have a hard time seeing how bitcoiners will be able to justify using proof-of-work to normal people. \n\nThe consensus mechanism debate is a tough one, and sure there are decent arguments for why proof-of-work can be better than proof-of-stake, but it is reeaaaally far-fetched to think that normal people are going to be able to understand these arguments. They will just point to another blockchain with PoS and say \"if they can arrive to consensus with PoS, why can't you?\" In this group of \"normal people\" you will also find 90% of politicians.\n\nBasically, the energy consumption argument is so easy for people to make and it will be sooo easy for politicians to just bash on proof-of-work chains, even if you think they are superior to proof-of-stake ones.

    "selftext": "X, Q:\nDoes this mean the NEVM chain is essentially like a layer2 for the syscoin's POW chain?\n\n\nJag, A:\nNot really.. it hasnt been done before.\nWithout PoW chain, NEVM chain cannot exist, PoW chain is ultimate authority. \n\nValidation depends on NEVM chain as well as they are both tied to each other but mainly whatever PoW chain says NEVM chain will follow.\n\nWith sidechains the consensus is usually not tied together.. they are seperate and usually bridged.. this is different as its all part of one protocol basically.\n\nDiogo, Q:\nBut there’s still a bridge between assets, since they are so tied, isn't there a way to automate this bridge?\n\nJag, A:\nThe bridge is decentralized and part of the protocol. It can be pretty simple.. but most people will be on NEVM layer. \n\nThey will not even go to SYS layer unless they want to HODL long term.  \n\nThen you might want to have your coins sit on the PoW layer on a change address (for quantum resistance). \nPali wallet will make it easy to cross either way. The dapp https://bridge-testnet.syscoin.org/ is only reference. \n\nDiogo, Q:\nI was thinking more of cases where you want SPTs and compliance but still want to use the NEVM.. isnt this bridging in/out all the time be costly?\n\nJag, A:\nYeah, if you want to leverage SPTs then to cross to NEVM will be just 1 block confirmation. \n\nThere’s no risk because everything is rolled back on both chains together so you can move coins and use them after 1 confirmation. \n\nX, Q:\nSo, does it work like layer 2 solutions such as Arbitrum where they use Ethereum as their security and validation layer? That means, NEVM is like Arbitrum and the Syscoin chain is like Ethereum?\n\nJag, A:\nNo because those are seperate consensus systems not tied together at a protocol level, ETH does not know what arbitrum is. \n\nIn ours Syscoin knows what NEVM is and NEVM knows what Syscoin is. \nIn ZKRollups on NEVM, that will be similar to ETH and L2 Arbitrum. \n\nIn Arbitrum if Ethereum rolls back a. block Arbitrum won’t know this and in Arbitrum if a rollback happens Ethereum won’t know. \n\nSo you need more trust assumptions and security mitigations which creates risk. \n\nX, Q:\nOhh... I'm trying to understand this idea of \"tied together\". What does tied together really mean? Since Syscoin and NEVM are separate chains, when we said tied together, do we mean they are able to read state data in contracts between the chains?\n\nJag, A:\nNEVM chain can read in the smart contract on the syscoin block hash of any last 50000 blocks. \n\nSyscoin chain knows all of the NEVM chain block hashes and merkle roots. \n\nThe process follows my article, PoW miner wants to create a block, he sends a msg via ZMQ socket to nevm node (geth) to package up a new block, sends to sys node, propogates SYS block with NEVM block inside, every block validats SYS block and passes nevm block data via ZMQ to validate NEVM block.. if  all is good SYS block is valid otherwise its rejected. \n\nThen chainlocks create finality on the PoW chain external to this process via masternodes locking the PoW chain based on what majority of masternodes see as the tip of the chain. \n\nDiogo, Q:\nDo you think fast L2's can be dangerous?\n\nJag, A:\nOptimistic rollups yes, ZKrollups no. \n\nDiogo, Q:\nBecause of slower finalities?\n\nJag, A:\nNo in ZKrollups you are guilty until proven innocent and in optimistic rollup you are innocent until proven guilty. \n\nEven though you are guilty until proven innocent the verification is exponentially scalable as more users use it. \n\nInnocent until guilty means court system can miss some cases just like real life. \n\nDiogo, Q:\nNever read much about optimistic rollups, but I guess the name already implies that\n\nJag, A:\nYup, optimistic in regular case, pessimistic when needed to be but requires someone to be watch dog. But requires long wait times to exit as a result since rollbacks arent tied together they are seperate chains and seperate consensus from l1-&amp;gt;l2...\n\nDiogo, Q:\nYeah, thats pretty bad too in extreme cases\n\nJag, A:\nIn Zkrollups the state only updates and things are verified on the spot... so invalid states cannot exist. \n\nX, Q:\nJust curious, since it's on POW, would it actually be taking up a lot of energy? I suppose that was the argument Ethereum has for moving to PoS?\n\nJag, A:\nWellif you think about the vision of blockchain, we are programming it for extreme cases. \nIt’s merge-mined with Bitcoin. \nSo unless you think bitcoin is going to disappear, SYS won’t either. \n\nThere is no value for blockchain in regular circumstances.. its value is derived from being secure from SHTF cases. \n\nIt’s borrowing energy from bitcoin, no new energy.. but PoW is cheaper than PoW anyway. \n\nX, Q:\nWhat does merge mined with bitcoin mean? Sorry, this is the first time I'm hearing this.\n\nJag, A:\nIf you mine Bitcoin you are solving for a nonce, the miner increments this number until the hash fits with so many 0's infront of it which is gauged by difficulty. \n\nWith that same solution you can apply it to other chains proving you solved difficulty more than a child chain. So you can mine multiple chains at once. \n\nX, Q:\nohh... POW is cheaper than POS in what way?\n\nJag:\n\nPOW is cheaper when factoring in all costs, external, internal and theoretical. \n\nMostly it matters when hyper inflated values affect the staked resource ie: ETH is traded against USD and USD hyper inflates.. ETH security falls in line with the inflation. \n\nX, Q:\nOhh... Interesting idea. Am I right to understand that this would mean we will need Bitcoin miners to also mine Syscoin at the same time, except that they don't really have to redo the computation they had done for Bitcoin. They can reuse the computation that done to solve for Bitcoin and also for Syscoin. So the Bitcoin miners will have to install the Syscoin mining software as well. Is that the idea?\n\nJag, A:\nSo what we offer is the non syntheziable energy consensus that is nakamoto PoW securing a very secure court system (NEVM) layer 1 chain.. and scaling that using ZKrollups which do not take away any security just enables scale for global adoption. \n\nIf ZKrollups existed when Crypto Kitties started, they wouldn’t be moving to PoS most likely.. another reason Vitalik wants to move to PoS is mainly because of light client security.. it’s too hard to run a full node yourself as a light node and too many trust assumptions. \n\nI counter that with PCD and math solutions coming out soon that will enable you to create validity proofs of entire chains meaning light clients will work trustlessly and you can move between any chain without any agents in the middle without trust. \n\nSo light client security, and scaling are both not reasons for us to move away from PoW.. the only argument left is energy consumption.. which is a PRO for using PoW over PoS not against.. because during times of panic and volatility the PoS system has a higher chance of failing causing permanent loss. \n\nX:\n\nThanks for the insight! Really interesting! I always thought PoS is the way to go since PoW requires wasteful computations by all the miners. I'm not quite sure about the part where how panic and volatility to the PoS system can cause permanent loss though. I thought it's only the stakers who are proven to have attempted to put a fraudulent block will lose their stakes?\n\nJag, A:\n\nWell during times of hyperinflation energy based chains will flourish becaues you cannot synthesize energy. There is no \"nothing at stake\" issue. \n\ni dont know at what point ETH becomes so easy to attack but I look at the relations to one or the other.. maybe it will be hard to attack ETH unless we are talking about hyper inflation like USD going to $1b to buy piece of bread. \n\nThe problem with PoS is.. once it is attacked they must fork to fix it. \n\nIn BTC you attack and it self regulates itself. \n\nThey added finality into the equation because of PoS you need to punish validators and slash them.. once finality is added in, now it can get stuck because of that finality. \n\nI haven’t done a full deep dive as to what exactly are the costs to attack that type of system, but I look at likeliness compared to PoW and it looks like it gets easier and easier in relation to the other.. if its practical or not is left to the scientists to model it out under different contexts. \n\nX, Q:\n\nI'm pretty new to this so I may not know what I'm talking but I'm guessing based on what you have said so far, it sounds like PoS would be more vulnerable for attack when the network is smaller? Eth has a pretty massive network. So maybe it's more difficult for them to be attacked. Many new and popular blockchains coming out are all using PoS and perhaps that kinda gives an impression to most people that PoS is the way to go.\n\nJag, A:\n\nDevil is the tiny details. Once PoS breaks its broken for good. Until the hand that feeds it will course correct. All of that should be factored into the costs. \n\nX, Q:\n\nAhh... So that means solidity smart contracts won't be able to get deployed on the NEVM chain?\n\nJag, A:\n\nSolidity will work it is an EVM. \n\nX, Q:\n\nOhh... Amazing! So NEVM runs the smart contracts in an EVM environment? Cool!\n\nJag, A:\n\nYup, its best to read that medium article. \nIt explains everything fully. \n\nX, Q:\n\nThat would mean the usual tools we use for developing solidity on Eth will also work on NEVM? Meaning, we only have to change the RPC endpoint to NEVM and it will work?\n\nJag, A:\n\nYes, \"stick to gold standards\".",

    "selftext": "[https://decrypt.co/82825/sienna-network-launches-privacy-centric-defi-crypto-exchange](https://decrypt.co/82825/sienna-network-launches-privacy-centric-defi-crypto-exchange)\n\nLaunched in April, the [Sienna Network](https://sienna.network/) is looking to usher in an ecosystem of privacy-focused decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://decrypt.co/resources/defi-ultimate-beginners-guide-decentralized-finance)) products. First up, a [Uniswap](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-uniswap)\\-esque decentralized exchange ([DEX](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-decentralized-exchange-dex)) called SiennaSwap. \n\nSiennaSwap lets users trade “secret versions” of popular tokens like [Ethereum](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-ethereum-quickly-explained-four-minute-guide) and [Cosmos](https://decrypt.co/resources/cosmos), and flip them anonymously on the platform. For now, the number of assets is limited to the bridges the project has created, hence the absence of a secret version of [Bitcoin](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-bitcoin-four-minute-instant-guide-explainer). \n\nThe only bridges available are to Ethereum, [Monero](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-are-privacy-coins-monero-zcash-and-dash-explained), [Polkadot](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-polkadot-how-to-buy-it), Cosmos, and [Binance Smart Chain](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-binance-smart-chain). Users are still able to create as many swap pairs as they like among each of the assets, however. \n\nAnd as the exchange is built atop the Sienna Network, which itself is powered by the Cosmos-based Secret Network, many of the interoperability questions will be answered once Cosmos finalizes its Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) upgrade. This upgrade lets blockchains with different consensus mechanisms, like Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW), integrate with the broader Cosmos ecosystem. \n\n(Continued in article)",

    "title": "Which Service is Better for Launching Cryptocurrency Exchange with Regulatory Compliance: Prime Trust or Zero Hash?",
    "selftext": "I recently joined a half-baked cryptocurrency startup as their Regulatory Compliance Officer and have been struggling to get everything in order. The founders have seemingly unlimited money to throw into the business, but apparently little technical understanding (or maybe regard) for the legal side of things.\n\nBasically, our team is attempting to launch three separate ventures under one umbrella corporation: a Cryptocurrency Exchange, a Wallet Application, and an ERC-20 Token. I think the ERC-20 token came first, perhaps as your typical crypto get-rich-quick scheme. They then designed a generic Cryptocurrency Exchange to list their coin on since it wasn't listed anywhere else. Finally, they designed a Wallet Application. I don't quite understand the inner mechanisms of crypto-technology, but I think the Wallet was created to provide users with the actual functionality to transfer their tokens off exchange as well as allow us to provide custodial services for coins on the exchange, which up until recently were essentially just IOUs people bought during the presale. All of this happened before I joined. \n\nThe thing is, they had apparently contracted with Prime Trust, a Trust Company based out of Nevada, to serve as a Custodian for our users' fiat and digital assets, as well as provide Anti-Money-Laundering (AML/KYC) verification and Liquidity Services, meaning our Exchange is basically just a data portal/middleman/pretty UI for our users' while Prime Trust is the true broker for their trades. As a trust Company, Prime Trust is not a licensed Money Transmitter. Since we never technically handle our customers' fiat or crypto, we shouldn't need Money Transmitter Licenses, right? Except for one problem: our ERC-20 token. \n\nSince this token isn't supported by Prime Trust and is, in fact, only available for purchase through our exclusive Exchange which routes tokens from our custodial wallet, then, unless I'm wrong, we DO need Money Transmitter Licenses for every state. Right now, I'm pretty sure customers can only purchase our token by first depositing ETH or BTC and then converting it, but I know they fully intend to begin offering ACH fiat-deposits/transfers to buy and sell the token.\n\nThat's where Zero Hash comes in. They provide essentially the same service as Prime Trust, but also happen to hold Money Transmitter Licenses in every state. Also, I'm not sure how important this is, but similar to Prime Trust, Zero Hash also only provides fiat/crypto liquidity for a select list of supported cryptocurrencies. However, as I understand it, with them fully licensed and serving as the true broker for our users, we wouldn't be required to hold the MTLs (Again, maybe I'm wrong). However, the founders are reluctant to switch from Prime Trust to Zero Hash since they've already paid Prime Trust. I don't know how much they paid, but I don't really see the switch so much as a matter of whether it's worth it  or not, but more so as a matter of necessity since acquiring our own Money Transmitter Licenses will most likely cost $1-2 million and take 2-3 years to complete.\n\nWhat do you guys think? This is all very confusing to me. What are our legal obligations here? Any crypto lawyers out there willing to weigh in?",

    "selftext": "*Disclaimer: I'm just here throwing ideas around and want to spark debate and incentivize discussion. I am probably in no way correct or trying to state any facts.*\n\n#Government issued currencies versus cryptocurrencies\n\nToday, I was browsing Reddit when I came upon a post criticizing cryptocurrencies and saying that government-issued currencies were clearly superior. The argument was that you can't buy everything, everyday stuff with any cryptocurrency and that nobody was being paid in cryptocurrencies, simply because they were too volatile, and that the only usecase they have is pure speculation. While 1 sat will always be 1 sat, the worth of 1 sat in every other currency in the world fluctuates wildly.\n\nThis reminded me of the in(famous) Bitcoin Black Paper by Nassim Taleb. He argued that you can't do trade with Bitcoin or any other volatile crypto because you would need to pay your supplier in crypto, and crypto might go up or down a lot, and that isn't good for doing business. (Not exactly his words, but you get the point).\n\n#**So, what's the solution?**\n\nI was thinking about stablecoins. What about stablecoins, then? But, the problem with stablecoins is that they bring us back to square one: why not just use FIAT directly? Brian Armstrong was talking about this, fiatcoins vs flatcoins. Fiatcoins are pegged to a currency, while flatcoins aren't pegged to any currency, but still remain *somewhat* stable. \n\n&gt;Two kinds of stablecoins.\n\n&gt;Fiatcoins are pegged to an external fiat currency like USD, directly or indirectly.\n\n&gt;Flatcoins are newer. If fiat itself starts to inflate, it isn’t really “stable”. So a flatcoin optimizes instead for price flatness vs an on-chain basket of goods.\n\n*Source: https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1402030233319088139?s=19*\n\nThe only problem with flatcoins is that they still fluctuate a lot compared to stablecoins, and as far as I'm aware, most of them don't have a usecase other than being a hedge against inflation INSIDE the crypto world.\n\n#The big question\n\nIs there any cryptocurrency used today to save, spend and be paid in, in the real world?\n\nYes, but no. The only crypto I'm aware is being used to buy bread at the local bakery, used to get a haircut, ride a taxi or be paid in is RSV in Venezuela. The Reserve team released an app that let's people convert hyperinflated bolívares into RSV, a fiatcoin pegged to the USD, that aims to depeg from it and track a basket of assets, but the transition from fiatcoin to flatcoin is still a long ways ahead. And not only that, but the app isn't transacting on-chain yet, so it's centralized in the meantime (although they intend to transact on-chain and give users self-custody once the Reserve Protocol mainnet releases).\n\n*If you want to learn more about Reserve: https://reserve.org/project/*\n\n#My humble take, as someone still learning\n\nReal, massive, everyday use crypto adoption as currencies will come in the form of a decentralized, stable, backed crypto**currency** that isn't pegged to anything but it's something in itself, essentially creating the crypto Bretton Woods *Basket* standard. To close this post, I'm going to quote none other than Vitalik himself:\n\n&gt;The latter because I'm thinking about stablecoins. Some people think stablecoins are purely transition tech, and post-hypercryptoization BTC or ETH will be stable. I think there's a big chance this is wrong and even post-hypercryptoization we would still need explicit stablecoins\n\n*Source: https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1433198571117895680?s=19*\n\n*Disclosure: I am personally invested into the Reserve Protocol ecosystem.*",

    "title": "Did you know Bitcoin can scale up to 4000 tx per second and still remain decentralised where full nodes can be run by hobbyists? Here is how:",
    "selftext": "Here is some napkin math on how long it would take a $1000 desktop computer to validate a 1GB block  once the known bottlenecks are resolved. (4000 tx a second)\n\n**First, block propagation.** With graphene, a typical 1 GB block can be encoded in about 20 kB, most of which is order information. With a canonical ordering, that number should drop to about 5 kB. Sending 20 kB or 5 kB over the internet is pretty trivial, and should add about **1 second** total.\n\n**Second, IBLT decoding.** I haven't seen any benchmarks for decoding the IBLTs in Graphene for 1 GB blocks, but in 2014 I saw some benchmarks for 1 MB blocks that showed decoding time to be around 10 ms. If it scales linearly, that would be **around 10 seconds** for decoding.\n\n**Third, block sorting.** A 1 GB block would have about 2.5 million transactions. Assuming that we're using a canonical lexical ordering, we will need to sort the txids for those transactions. Single-threaded sorting is typically between 1 million keys per second and (for uint64_t keys) 10 million keys per second, so sorting should take around **1 second**.\n\n**Fourth, computing and verifying the merkle root hash.** The amount of hashing needed to do this is equal to 1 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.125 + ... = 2 times the summed length of the txids, multiplied by two because we do two rounds of SHA256. With 2.5 million transactions, that's 320 MB of hashing. SHA256 can do around 300 MB/s on a single core, so this will take about **1 second**.\n\n**Fifth, block validation**. This step is hard to estimate, because we don't have any good benchmarks for how an ideal implementation would perform, nor do we even have a good idea of what the ideal implementation would look like. Does the node have the full UTXO set in RAM, or does it need to do SSD reads? Are we going to shard the UTXO set by txid across multiple nodes? Are we using flash or Optane for the SSD reads and writes? But this napkin math, so here's a shot. A 1 GB block is likely to have around 5 million inputs and 5 million outputs. Database reads can be done as a single disk IO op pretty easily, but writes generally have to be done more carefully, with separate writes to the journal, and then to multiple levels of the database tree structure. For the sake of simplicity, let's assume that each database write consists of four disk writes plus one disk read, or 5 ops total. This means that a 1 GB block will require around 10 million reads and 20 million writes. Current-gen m.2 PCIE NVMe top-of-the-line SSDs can get up to 500k IOPS. In two years, a good (but not top-end) SSD will probably be getting around 1 million random IOPS in both reads and writes. This would put the disk accesses at around **30 seconds** of delay. Sharding the database onto multiple SSDs or multiple nodes can reduce that, but I presume desktop computers won't have access to that. If we have Optane, the UTXO stuff should get way faster (10x? 50x?), as Optane has byte-level addressability for both reads and writes, so we will no longer need to read and write 4 kB blocks for each 30 byte UTXO. Optane also has much better latency, so a good database will be able to get lower write amplification without needing to worry about corruption.\n\n**Zeroth, script verification**. This is generally done when a transaction hits mempool, and those validation results are cached for later use, so no substantial extra script verification should need to be done during block validation. All we need is to make sure AcceptToMemoryPool doesn't get bogged down in the 10 minutes before the block. A single CPU core can verify about 5000 p2pkh scripts (i.e. single ECDSA sigop) per second, so an 8-core desktop should be able to handle 40,000 p2pkh inputs per second. Verifying the 5 million inputs in advance should take 125 seconds out of our 600 second window. That's cutting our safety margins a bit close, but it's tolerable for a non-mission-critical min-spec machine. Because this is done in advance, that 125/600 seconds turns into **0 seconds** for the sake of this calculation.\n\n**All told**, we have about (1 + 10 + 1 + 0.5 + 30) = **42.5 seconds** for a decent desktop to receive and verify a 1 GB block, assuming that all the code bottlenecks get fixed. There are probably a few other steps that I didn't think of, so maybe 60 seconds is a more fair estimate. Still, it's reasonable.\n\nMiners will, of course, need to be able to receive and process blocks much faster than this, but they will have the funding to buy computers with much greater parallelization, so their safety margin versus what they can afford should be about the same as for a casual desktop user.\n\n\n\nupstream bandwidth  largely depends on how many peers that our user has. Let's assume that our desktop user is a middle-class hobbyist, and is only sacrificing peer count a little bit in favor of reduced hardware requirements. Our user has 8 peers.\n\nTransaction propagation comes from 3 different p2p messages. \n\n**The first message is the INV message**, which is used to announce that a node knows one or more transactions with a specified TXID or TXIDs. These INV messages are usually batched into groups of 3 or so right now, but in a higher-throughput context, would likely be batched in groups of 20. The TCP/IP and other overhead is significant, so an INV for a single TXID is around 120 bytes, and each additional TXID adds around 40 bytes (not the 32 byte theoretical minimum). With 20 tx per inv, that's 880 bytes. For each peer connection, half of the transactions will be part of a received INV, and half will be part of a sent INV. This means that per 2.5 million transactions (i.e. one block) per peer, our node would send and receive 55 MB. For all 8 peers, that would be **440 MB** in each direction for INVs.\n\n**The second and third messages are the tx request and the tx response.** With overhead, these two messages should take around 600 bytes for a 400 byte transaction. If our node downloads each transaction once and uploads once, that turns into **1.5 GB** of traffic in each direction per block.\n\nLastly, we need to propagate the blocks themselves. With Graphene, the traffic needed for this step is trivial, so we can ignore it.\n\nIn total, we have **about 1.94 GB bidirectional** of traffic during each (average) 600 second block interval. That translates to average bandwidth of 3.23 MB/s or **25.9 Mbps**. This is, again, reasonable to expect for a motivated middle-class hobbyist around 2020, though not trivial.",

    "selftext": "Hi. I'm not a dev or coder. I know almost nothing about the guts that make the things I use daily work. I have a general tech background but mostly on the consumer side.  Also a blockchain enthusiast and very interested in the benefits (and difficulties) of decentralization.\n\nI'm looking for suggestions or guidance how or where I might be able to get involved with blockchain solutions to the massive privacy and security issues concerning big data like Goog &amp; FB.\n\nI've been trying to find a project that is focusing on these issues and using blockchain tech to solve it. \n\nTo keep it short:\nAs a person with 100s of gigs of data across many formats but without the necessary knowhow or funds to run my own server I would gladly pay a fee of some kind to incentivize validator nodes to exist.  What I am surprised to not find or looking in the wrong places is a means to:\n\n-Have a personal, private chunk of storage space with a similar UX front end like G - drive or Dropbox\n\n-Have the data I store on it be end to end encrypted as well as encrypted at rest, but seamless on the front end (synchronized so it doesn't seem like I'm encrypting new files each time I access them or add to existing files such as a photos folder or a text document)\n\n-Have the data segmented across multiple nodes in a zero knowledge system that even if the data was decrypted, it would be junk because it's missing the other segments that only I have the key for that joins them together. \n\n-Be able to access this data anywhere on the planet with internet connection and a Ledger-like device for signing tx.  \n\n-An offline mode where I could download a set of data such as photos, close my network connection, edit and add to/erase from the set then at some point dump it back on the network with instructions to replace the older data with the new. (Or any combo of options here for sync)\n\n-Network is impervious to centralized takeover for data mining and analytics, i.e. can't be bought out by a Snoogle and harvested for organs.\n\n-A fee structure based in crypto where one would pay per tx (same as smart contracts or Bitcoin network) or pay a monthly fee in the crypto.  Dunno if the coin would be inflationary or deflationary but something that gave incentive for validators and delegators to participate in. Right down to the end user who is a good actor and swaps their consumer CPU power or drive space to the network in exchange for access to the decentralized off-site benefits of network data storage.\n\n-Scalability to eventually offer an Enterprise solution along with the consumer end of it.\n\n-P2p sharing of files same as any crypto network today with value txs. \n\n-redundant backups obviously so any single point of failure is not catastrophic.\n\n... And more.  But I'll stop there.  So yes, I know p2p already exists and there were things like Napster. But it was sketch and current torrent servers are overrun with malicious actors.  So something that requires som kind of stake and proof (PoS?) to participate freely but securely and I dunno I guess there's a bunch of problems in not mentioning.\n\nSo, does anything like this exist or is there a project focused on this sorta thing? I'm sure many do I just haven't found any that are or are trying to cover all bases.  \n\nMight someone point me in a direction? And I apologize if this is a ridiculous post and already is in use 10 years ago.  I'm old, sorry. Im still learning how to set the clock on my DVD player. But I really would love to be able to have a secure, private, encrypted, decentralized space to store decades worth of personally significant data without being mined to death by Big Data.\n\nThanks \nCheers",

    "title": "A Simple Overview of BTC and ETH Accounting models",
    "selftext": "What is a blockchain? Simply put, blockchain is a digital ledger which records transactions (blocks) in a way that makes it difficult to hack, cheat, change or corrupt (this is for \"public\" blockchains not \"private\"). In a blockchain network, transactions are happening all over the place and it is important to account for these transactions so that the digital ledger is trusted and reliable. There are two main accounting models in blockchain today. There is the UTXO model, which is used by Bitcoin. UTXO stands for Unspent Transaction Output. What is meant by this is that an output (**an ending**) of a transaction can be used as an input (**a start**) of a new transaction. \n\nHere's a scenario to visualize what a UTXO is:\n \nBob has 0.8 BTC in his BTC wallet. Although you may think of Bob's 0.8 BTC simply as a fraction of 1 BTC, it would be better to think of Bob's 0.8 BTC as an **accumulation** of previous UTXO's. Theoretically speaking, Bob's 0.8 BTC could be made up of 0.3 BTC and 0.5 BTC from outputs of previous transactions (aka Unspent Transaction Output; UTXO). In other words, what's left over from his previous transactions account for his current balance of 0.8 BTC. \n\nHere's a real world equivalent of what UTXOs represent:\n\nLets say you have a $20 bill in your wallet. You go to the market, buy some food and the cashier says, \"That will be $16.50.\" You give your $20 bill to the cashier and he gives you back $3.50 in change. Now think about this scenario in terms of UTXO. That $3.50 the cashier gave you back as change is the **Unspent Transaction Output** (UTXO) and can now be used as the **input** for a new transaction.\n\nThis UTXO accounting model is simple and it was designed that way (Bitcoin was conceived as a form of digital cash). So the UTXO model is essentially the method for keeping track of where coins are at any given moment. There is another accounting model which also keeps track of where coins/tokens are at any given moment. But it is different from UTXO and it is referred to as the **Account model**. \n\nThe **Account model** is used by **Ethereum** and differs from the UTXO model of Bitcoin. In the account model of Ethereum, transactions are direct and simpler than in the UTXO model. Here's an example: \n\nYou have 50 ETH in your wallet. You'd like to send 10 ETH to your friend. Your friend has 5 ETH in his wallet. So you send 10 ETH from your wallet to your friend's wallet. 10 ETH is subtracted from your wallet and 10 ETH is added to your friend's wallet. You now have 40 ETH and your friend has 15 ETH. This account model is simpler than the UTXO model and is similar to how your bank account works. Your bank account balance increases if money comes into your account. Your bank account balance decreases when money goes out of the account (like when you decided to throw $100 at that moonshot shitcoin, but lets not talk about that). \n\n**TLDR** UTXO stands for Unspent Transaction Output and is the accounting model of the Bitcoin network. It offers simplicity which makes verifying balances easy, and is competent for the purpose of facilitating payments. Ethereum uses a account model, which is simpler than UTXO and akin to how traditional finance operate.",

    "selftext": "[https://messari.io/article/shhhhh-it-s-a-secret-network](https://messari.io/article/shhhhh-it-s-a-secret-network)\n\nCrypto is redefining the power dynamics for the next evolution of finance and application creation. It introduces a bottom-up approach to building new financial infrastructure, allowing users to police network activity and help dictate the direction of each project. Unlike the financial and capital formation systems that govern us today, users themselves wield the power.\n\nPublic blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum operate according to these standards. Bitcoin was created in part to provide a check on central bankers that are prone to mismanaging money supplies and abusing their immense power. Ethereum unlocked the ability to create globally accessible programmable applications that can be governed by a community of token holders and open-source contributors. These models created the conditions for realizing the first part of Naval’s thesis for crypto: maximum decentralization.\n\nHowever, while Bitcoin and Ethereum excel at distributing power to the many, their current public-by-default designs will likely not provide a full solution for Naval’s second outcome - maximum privacy - now or anytime soon.\n\nThis lack of user privacy stands out starkly in the modern age of surveillance capitalism and state-level surveillance. The transparency of Bitcoin and Ethereum may only feed into these existing concerns. They enable end-to-end surveillance on every financial transaction for each wallet, and supplementary solutions like mixers face liquidity and usability challenges that may limit the level of privacy they can offer.\n\nPrivacy coins like Monero and Zcash sprung up to address these issues. They use complex cryptography to obfuscate transaction details, thereby preserving user privacy and increasing security. But they fall short in meeting the demands of DeFi users since neither supports smart contracts at this time, creating a gap in the market.\n\nSecret Network aims to fill this void. It’s one of the first blockchains to support programmable smart contracts with privacy by default, which launched on the Secret mainnet in September 2020. Secret will face its fair share of hurdles trying to build up a user base, like overcoming users’ general apprehension towards sacrificing convenience over privacy. However, private smart contracts also introduce significant usability advantages and unlock important new use cases. As privacy graduates from a nice-to-have to a necessary feature for users of complex Web3 applications, Secret Network could be one of the sector leaders for private computation.\n\nHere's the link to the full article: [https://messari.io/article/shhhhh-it-s-a-secret-network](https://messari.io/article/shhhhh-it-s-a-secret-network)",

Long time Cardinian here.\n\nWith the issues facing Minswap, the idea that the sentence: “Cardano is peer reviewed, therefore it is the safest, fastest, most scalable and most eco friendly blockchain,” in my mind is no longer valid.  While the flaw may not have been terminal, concurrency wasn’t written into layer 1, which I think shows peer review alone isn’t enough to set the project apart.\n\nSo I’m asking, from a technical standpoint, what’s different about Cardano in one sentence that sets it head and shoulders above other cryptocurrencies?\n\nI’ll give some examples:\n\n“Bitcoin was the first mover and has the network effect, therefore it is head and shoulders above all other crypto.”\n\n“Solana created proof of history, making its blockchain the most secure against manipulation and the fastest and most secure, therefore it’s the most baller crypto.”\n\n“Dogecoin is a coin with proven social utility based on it’s sharable meme nature and simplicity, therefore it’s the best social coin.”\n\nI’ll leave this here.
